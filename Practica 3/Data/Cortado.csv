We show that if G is a weighted graph with an involution, then the resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index of G can be expressed in terms of parameters of two weighted graphs with a smaller size. As applications, we compute resistance distances and Kirchhoff indices of double graphs, the almost-complete graph and the almost-complete bipartite graph. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Involution; Kirchhoff index; Laplacian matrix; Resistance distance","Graph theory; Matrix algebra; Complete bipartite graphs; Complete graphs; Double graphs; Involution; Kirchhoff indices; Laplacian matrices; Resistance distance; Weighted graph; Graphic methods","Bedrosian, S., Converse of the star-mesh transformation (1961) IRE Trans.

In this paper, based on the knowledge of compositions of an integer, a new construction of balanced 2p-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity is provided, where p is an odd prime. The nonlinearity of our new functions is significantly higher than all previously obtained balanced even-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity, and is higher than the best nonlinearity of even-variable rotation symmetric Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity in most cases. We also show that our new functions have high algebraic degree and a good behavior against fast algebraic attacks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Algebraic degree; Algebraic immunity; Fast algebraic attack; Nonlinearity; Rotation symmetric Boolean function","Algebra; Rotation; Algebraic degrees; Algebraic immunity; Fast algebraic attack; Nonlinearity; Rotation symmetric boolean functions; Boolean functions","Armknecht, F., Carlet, C., Gaborit, P., Knzli, S., Meier, W., Ruatta, O., Efficient computation of algebraic immunity for algebraic and fast algebraic attacks (2006) Advances in Cryptology, EUROCRYPT 2006, LNCS, 4004, pp. 147-164; Carlet, C., (2006) A method of construction of balanced functions with optimum algebraic immunity, , http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/149; Carlet, C., Dalai, D., Gupta, K., Maitra, S., Algebraic immunity for cryptographically significant Boolean functions: analysis and construction (2006) IEEE Trans.
