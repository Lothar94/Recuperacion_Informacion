However, it is often a restrictive model, not supported by the data even in cases in which the researcher tends to believe that a certain variable is somehow smaller than other. Alternatively, we propose to look at a more flexible version in which two distributions satisfy an approximate stochastic order relation if they are slightly contaminated versions of distributions for which stochastic order holds. The minimal level of contamination required for stochastic order to hold is used as a measure of deviation from exact stochastic order model. Our approach is based on the use of trimmings of probabilities. We discuss their connection to approximate stochastic order and provide theoretical support for its use in data analysis, proving uniform consistency and giving non-asymptotic bounds for the error probabilities of our tests. We provide simulation results and a case study for illustration. © 2016, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotics; Bootstrap; Contamination model; Stochastic order; Trimmed distribution; Uniformly consistent test,,"Álvarez-Esteban, P.C., del Barrio, E., Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Matrán, C., Trimmed comparison of distributions (2008) J Am Stat Assoc, 103, pp. 697-704; Álvarez-Esteban, P.C., del Barrio, E., Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Matrán, C., Uniqueness and approximate computation of optimal incomplete transportation plans (2011) Annales de l’Institut Henri Poincaré Probabilités et Statistiques, 47, pp. 358-375; Álvarez-Esteban, P.C., del Barrio, E., Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Matrán, C., Similarity of samples and trimming (2012) Bernoulli, 18, pp. 606-634; http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1920, Álvarez-Esteban PC, del Barrio E, Cuesta-Albertos JA, Matrán C (2014) A contamination model for approximate stochastic order: extended versionAnderson, G., Nonparametric tests for stochastic dominance (1996) Econometrica, 64, pp. 1183-1193; Arcones, M.A., Kvam, P.H., Samaniego, F.J., Nonparametric estimation of a distribution subject to a stochastic precedence constraint (2002) J Am Stat Assoc, 97, pp. 170-182; Barrett, G.F., Donald, S.G., Consistent tests for stochastic dominance (2003) Econometrica, 71, pp. 71-104; Barron, A.R., Uniformly powerful goodness of fit tests (1989) Ann Stat, 17, pp. 107-124; Berger, R.L., A nonparametric, intersection-union test for stochastic order (1988) Statistical decision theory and related topics IV, , Gupta SS, Berger JO, (eds), 2, Springer-Verlag, New York; Davidson, R., Duclos, J.Y., Statistical inference for stochastic dominance and for the measurement of poverty and inequality (2000) Econometrica, 68, pp. 1435-1464; Davidson, R., Duclos, J.Y., Testing for restricted stochastic dominance (2013) Econ Rev, 32, pp. 84-125; Gordaliza, A., Best approximations to random variables based on trimming procedures (1991) J Approx Theor, 64, pp. 162-180; Hodges, J.L., Lehmann, E.L., Testing the approximate validity of statistical hypotheses (1954) J R Stat Soc B, 16, pp. 261-268; Lehmann, E.L., Ordered families of distributions (1955) Ann Math Stat, 26, pp. 399-419; Lindsay, B.G., Liu, J., Model assessment tools for a model false world (2009) Stat Sci, 24, pp. 303-318; Linton, O., Maasoumi, E., Whang, Y.J., Consistent testing for stochastic dominance under general sampling schemes (2005) Rev Econ Stud, 72, pp. 735-765; Linton, O., Song, K., Whang, Y.J., An improved bootstrap test for stochastic dominance (2010) J Econ, 154, pp. 186-202; Liu, J., Lindsay, B.G., Building and using semiparametric tolerance regions for parametric multinomial models (2009) Ann Stat, 37, pp. 3644-3659; McFadden, D., Testing for stochastic dominance (1989) Studies in the economics of uncertainty, , Fomby TB, Seo TK, (eds), Springer, In Honor of Josef Hadar; Mosler, K., Testing whether two distributions are stochastically ordered or not (1995) Grundlagen der Statistik und ihre Anwendungen: Festschrift für Kurt Weichselberger, , Rinne H, Rüger B, Strecker H, (eds), Springer, Heidelberg; Müller, A., Stoyan, D., (2002) Comparison methods for stochastic models and risks, , Wiley, Chichester; Raghavachari, M., Limiting distributions of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov type statistics under the alternative (1973) Ann Stat, 1, pp. 67-73; Rudas, T., Clogg, C.C., Lindsay, B.G., A New Index of Fit Based on Mixture Methods for the Analysis of Contingency Tables (1994) J R Stat Soc B, 56, pp. 623-639; Shaked, M., Shanthikumar, J.G., (2007) Stochastic orders, , Springer, New York; Schmid, F., Trede, M., Testing for first order stochastic dominance in either direction (1996) Comput Stat, 11, pp. 165-173; Schmid, F., Trede, M., Testing for first-order stochastic dominance: a new distribution-free test (1996) Statistician, 45, pp. 371-380; Shorack, G.R., (1986) Wellner JA, , Empirical processes with applications to statistics, Wiley",English,Article

The frailty term is assumed to be constant over time. This assumption is questionable in some particular settings, e.g., in cancer clinical trials on chronic myeloid leukaemia. We therefore relax the time-constant heterogeneity assumption and consider frailty models with a time-varying frailty term. Instead of working with hazard models, we rather model the log cumulative hazard function, making use of the mixed model framework, and introduce a time-varying random effect at that level. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method has acceptable size and power to detect time-dependent clustering. The method is applied to data from a large-scale multicentre clinical trial in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Frailty model; Linear mixed effects model; Log cumulative hazard model; Multivariate survival; Time-varying random effects,,"Claeskens, G., Nguti, R., Janssen, P., Likelihood ratio and score tests for a shared frailty model: a non-standard problem (2008) Test, 17 (1), pp. 69-82; Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap methods and their application, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Duchateau, L., Janssen, P., (2008) The frailty model, , Springer, New York; Fong, D.Y.T., Lam, K.F., Lawless, J.F., Lee, Y.W., Dynamic random effects models for times between repeated events (2001) Lifetime Data Anal, 7 (4), pp. 345-362; Gjessing, H.K., Aalen, O.O., Hjort, N.L., Frailty models based on Lévy processes (2003) Adv Appl Probab, 35 (2), pp. 532-550; Gratwohl, A., The EBMT risk score (2012) Bone Marrow Transplant, 47 (6), pp. 749-756; Lam, K.F., Lee, Y.W., Leung, T.L., Modeling multivariate survival data by a semiparametric random effects proportional odds model (2002) Biometrics, 58 (2), pp. 316-323; Legrand, C., Sylvester, R., Duchateau, L., Janssen, P., Therasse, P., Treatment outcome studies: pitfalls in current methods and practice (2002) Eur J Cancer, 38 (9), pp. 1173-1180; Legrand, C., Duchateau, L., Sylvester, R., Janssen, P., van der Hage, J.A., van de Velde, C.J.H., Therasse, P., Heterogeneity in disease free survival between centers: lessons learned from an EORTC breast cancer trial (2006) Clin Trials, 3 (1), pp. 10-18; Littell, R.C., Pendergast, J., Natarajan, R., Modelling covariance structure in the analysis of repeated measures data (2000) Stat Med, 19 (13), pp. 1793-1819; Littell, R.C., Milliken, G.A., Stroup, W.W., Wolfinger, R.D., Schabenberger, O., (2006) SAS for mixed models, , SAS Institute, Cary; López-de-Ullibarri, I., Janssen, P., Cao, R., Continuous covariate frailty models for censored and truncated clustered data (2012) J Stat Plan Inference, 142 (7), pp. 1864-1877; Manda, S.O.M., Meyer, R., Bayesian inference for recurrent events data using time-dependent frailty (2005) Stat Med, 24 (8), pp. 1263-1274; Massonnet, G., Burzykowski, T., Janssen, P., Resampling plans for frailty models (2006) Commun Stat Simulat, 35 (2), pp. 497-514; Massonnet, G., Janssen, P., Burzykowski, T., Fitting conditional survival models to meta-analytic data by using a transformation toward mixed-effects models (2008) Biometrics, 64 (3), pp. 834-842; Moeschberger, M.L., Klein, J.P., A comparison of several methods of estimating the survival function when there is extreme right censoring (1985) Biometrics, 41 (1), pp. 253-259; Paik, M.C., Tsai, W.Y., Ottman, R., Multivariate survival analysis using piecewise gamma frailty (1994) Biometrics, 50 (4), pp. 975-988; Pennell, M.L., Dunson, D.B., Bayesian semiparametric dynamic frailty models for multiple event time data (2006) Biometrics, 62 (4), pp. 1044-1052; Putter, H., (2015) van Houwelingen HC, , Dynamic frailty models based on compound birth-death processes, Biostatistics; Rice, W.R., Gaines, S.D., Extending nondirectional heterogeneity tests to evaluate simply ordered alternative hypotheses (1994) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 91 (1), pp. 225-226; Rice, W.R., Gaines, S.D., The ordered-heterogeneity family of tests (1994) Biometrics, 50 (3), pp. 746-752; Teodorescu, B., Van Keilegom, I., Cao, R., Generalized time-dependent conditional linear models under left truncation and right censoring (2010) Ann Inst Stat Math, 62 (3), pp. 465-485; Wang, K., Yau, K.K.W., Lee, A.H., McLachlan, G.J., Multilevel survival modelling of recurrent urinary tract infections (2007) Comput Method Prog Biomed, 87 (3), pp. 225-229; Wintrebert, C.M.A., Putter, H., Zwinderman, A.H., van Houwelingen, H.C., Centre-effect on survival after bone marrow transplantation: Application of time-dependent frailty models (2004) Biom J, 46, pp. 512-525; Yau, K.K.W., McGilchrist, C.A., ML and REML estimation in survival analysis with time dependent correlated frailty (1998) Stat Med, 17 (11), pp. 1201-1213; Yue, H., Chan, K.S., A dynamic frailty model for multivariate survival data (1997) Biometrics, 53 (3), pp. 785-793",English,Article

Using the concept of partial coverage distance, those demand points within the area of the annulus are served at no cost, while for ‘uncovered’ demand points there will be additional costs proportional to their distances to the annulus. The objective of the problem is to locate the annulus such that the sum of distances from the uncovered demand points to the annulus (covering area) is minimized. The distance is measured by the Euclidean norm. We discuss the case where the radius of the inner circle of the annulus is variable, and prove that at least two demand points must be on the boundary of any optimal annulus. An algorithm to solve the problem is derived based on this result. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Covering location models; Median circle problem; Minisum annulus,,,English,Article in Press

Parameter interpretation in mixed logistic model is not straightforward since the odds ratio is random. For the proposed models, we obtain the odds ratio distribution and its summaries used to interpret the fixed effects and to measure the heterogeneity among the clusters thus extending previous results. Fisher information is also obtained. A Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is considered to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates. A simulation study is performed comparing normal and heavy-tailed models. It also address the effect of the misspecification of the random effect distribution and other model aspects in the parameter interpretation. A data analysis is performed showing the utility of heavy-tailed mixed logistic model. Among the main conclusions, we note that the misspecification of the random effect distribution influences the fixed effects interpretation and the quantification of the among clusters heterogeneity. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",EM-type algorithm; Heavy tail; Random odds ratio,,,English,Article in Press

These problems extend the well-known undirected rural postman problem to the case where there are several depots instead of just one. Linear integer programming formulations that only use binary variables are proposed for the problem that minimizes the overall routing costs and for the model that minimizes the length of the longest route. An exact branch-and-cut algorithm is presented for each considered model, where violated constraints of both types are separated in polynomial time. Despite the difficulty of the problems, the numerical results from a series of computational experiments with various types of instances illustrate a quite good behavior of the algorithms. When the overall routing costs are minimized, over 43 % of the instances were optimally solved at the root node, and 95 % were solved at termination, most of them with a small additional computational effort. When the length of the longest route is minimized, over 25 % of the instances were optimally solved at the root node, and 99 % were solved at termination. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Arc routing; Binary formulation; Multi-depot rural postman problem,,,English,Article in Press

They provide a model in which the regression function is decomposed as a sum of functions, each of them depending only on a single explanatory variable. The advantage of additive models over general non-parametric regression models is that they allow to obtain estimators converging at the optimal univariate rate avoiding the so-called curse of dimensionality. Beyond backfitting, marginal integration is a common procedure to estimate each component in additive models. In this paper, we propose a robust estimator of the additive components which combines local polynomials on the component to be estimated with the marginal integration procedure. The proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. A simulation study allows to show the advantage of the proposal over the classical one when outliers are present in the responses, leading to estimators with good robustness and efficiency properties. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Additive models; Kernel weights; Local M-estimation; Marginal integration; Robustness,,,English,Article in Press

In this study, we propose a new formulation for ASP with salient features. The proposed formulation that is based on the travelling salesman problem enables more efficient use of search platforms and solutions to realistic problems in reasonable time. We also present a max–min version of ASP that maximizes the minimum probability of target detection given the maximum flight distance of an aerial platform.

The system size probabilities in transient state are obtained in closed form using generating functions and steady-state system size probabilities are derived in closed form using generating functions and continued fractions.

The new multi-period risk measure is monotonous and convex when the two real-valued functions satisfy monotonicity and convexity. Based on this generic framework, we construct a specific class of time-consistent multi-period risk measure by considering the lower partial moment between the realized wealth and the target wealth at individual periods. With the new multi-period risk measure as the objective function, we formulate a multi-period portfolio selection model by considering transaction costs at individual investment periods. Furthermore, this stochastic programming model is transformed into a deterministic programming problem using the scenario tree technology.

In this new variant, under this assumption of probability distribution, the problem can be traditionally formulated as a binary SOCP for which the continuous relaxation is convex. In this paper, we reformulate the problem as a binary quadratic constrained program for which the continuous relaxation is not necessarily convex. We propose several linearization techniques for latter: the classical linearization proposed by Fortet (Trabajos de Estadistica 11(2):111–118, 1960) and the linearization proposed by Sherali and Smith (Optim Lett 1(1):33–47, 2007). In addition to the basic implementation of the latter, we propose an improvement which includes, in the computation, constraints coming from the SOCP formulation. Numerical results show that an improvement of Sherali–Smith’s linearization outperforms largely the binary SOCP program and the classical linearization when investigated in a branch-and-bound approach. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Branch-and-bound; Chance constrained programming; Graph partitioning; Quadratic 0/1 programming; Second-order cone programming,Bins; Branch and bound method; Combinatorial optimization; Computer programming; Graph theory; Probability distributions; Stochastic systems; Branch-and-bound approaches; Chance-constrained programming; Continuous relaxation; Graph Partitioning; Graph partitioning problems; Knapsack constraints; Linearization technique; Second-order cone programming; Linearization,"Barahona, F., Mahjoub, A.R., On the cut polytope (1986) Math.

Applications may be found in data centers, smart traffic-light control and human behavior. Specifically, whenever the server attends queue i (Qi) and the number of customers in the other queue, Qj (i, j= 1 , 2 ; j≠ i), reaches its threshold level, the server immediately switches to Qj whenever Qi is below its threshold. When a served Qi becomes empty we consider two scenarios: (i) non-work-conserving; and (ii) work-conserving. We present occasions where the non-work-conserving policy is more economical than the work-conserving policy when high switching costs are involved. An intrinsic feature of the process is an oscillation phenomenon: when the occupancy of Qi decreases the occupancy of the other queue increases. This fact is illustrated and discussed. By formulating the system as a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain we provide a probabilistic analysis of the system and investigate the effects of buffer sizes and arrival rates, as well as service rates, on the system’s performance.

Also, we developed a practical method based on TCIA as well as TOCIA operators for multiple attribute group decision making. Furthermore, in this approach alternative assessments are computed by the aggregation of 2-tuple linguistic information. Therefore, ranking alternatives or selecting the most desirable ones will be the outcome of the comparison between the 2-tuple linguistic information. Ultimately, the demonstration of the developed approaches, its practicality and its effectiveness is proved by a numerical example and a comparison with results issued from Wan method (Knowl-Based Syst 45:31–40, 2013). © 2016, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Aggregation operators; Choquet integral; Fuzzy linguistic information; Group decision making,,"Beliakov, G., James, S., Mordelová, J., Rückschlossová, T., Yager, R.R., Generalized Bonferroni mean operators in multi-criteria aggregation (2010) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 161 (17), pp. 2227-2242; Bonissone, P.P., Decker, K.S., Selecting uncertainty calculi and granularity: an experiment in trading-off precision and complexity (1986) Uncertainty in artificial intelligence, , Kanal LH, Lemmer JF, (eds), North-Holland, Amsterdam; Bonferroni, C., Sulle medie multiple di potenze (1950) Bollettino dell’Unione Matematica Italiana, 5 (3-4), pp. 267-270; Bordogna, G., Fedrizzi, M., Pasi, G., A linguistic modeling of consensus in group decision making based on OWA operators (1997) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part: A Syst Hum, 27, pp. 126-133; Cabrerizo, F.J., Alonso, S., Herrera-Viedma, E., A Consensus model for group decision making problems with unbalanced fuzzy linguistic information (2009) Int J Inf Technol Decis Maki, 8 (1), pp. 109-131; Carlsson, C., Fuller, R., Benchmarking and linguistic importance weighted aggregations (2000) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 114 (1), pp. 35-42; Choquet, G., Theory of capacities (1953) Annales de l’Institut Fourier, 5, pp. 131-295; de Campos, M.L., Jorge Bolanos, M., Characterization and comparison of Sugeno and Choquet integrals (1992) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 52, pp. 61-67; Degani, R., Bortolan, G., The problem of linguistic approximation in clinical decision making (1988) Int J Approx Reason, 2 (2), pp. 143-162; Delgado, M., Verdegay, J.L., Vila, M.A., On aggregation operations of linguistic labels (1993) Int J Intell Syst, 8 (2), pp. 351-370; Estrella, F.J., Espinilla, M., Herrera, F., Martínez, L., FLINTSTONES: a fuzzy linguistic decision tools enhancement suite based on the 2-tuple linguistic model and extensions (2014) Inf Sci, 280, pp. 152-170; Fan, Z.P., Feng, B., Sun, Y.H., Ou, W., Evaluating knowledge management capability of organizations: a fuzzy linguistic method (2009) Expert Syst Appl, 36 (1), pp. 3346-3354; Feng, B., Fan, Z.P., Suo, W.L., A fuzzy linguistic method for evaluating collaboration satisfaction of NPD team using mutual-evaluation information (2009) Int J Prod Econ, 122 (2), pp. 547-557; Grabisch, M., Fuzzy integrals in multicriteria decision making (1995) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 69, pp. 279-298; Grabisch, M., k-order additive discrete fuzzy measures and their representation (1997) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 92, pp. 167-189; Grabisch, M., Nguyen, H.T., Walker, E.A., (1995) Fundamentals of uncertainty calculi with applications to fuzzy inference, , Kluwer Academics Publishers, Dordrecht; Harsanyi, J.C., Cardinal welfare, individualistic ethics, and interpersonal comparisons of utility (1955) J Polit Econ, 63, pp. 309-321; Herrera, F., Herrera-Viedma, E., Linguistic decision analysis: steps for solving decision problems under linguistic information (2000) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 115, pp. 67-82; Herrera, F., Herrera-Viedma, E., Choice functions and mechanisms for linguistic preference relations (2000) Eur J Oper Res, 120, pp. 144-161; Herrera, F., Martinez, L., An approach for combining linguistic and numerical information based on 2-tuple fuzzy representation model in decision-making (2000) Int J Uncertainty Fuzziness Knowl-Based Syst, 8 (5), pp. 539-562; Herrera, F., Martinez, L., A 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model for computing with words (2000) IEEE Trans Fuzzy Syst, 8 (6), pp. 746-752; Herrera, F., Martinez, L., A model based on linguistic 2-tuples for dealing with multigranularity hierarchical linguistic contexts in multiexpert decision-making (2001) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part B: Cybern, 31 (2), pp. 227-234; Herrera, F., Martinez, L., The 2-tuple linguistic computational model.

We show that the novel estimator achieves minimax rates in supremum norm and the low-dimensional components of the estimator have a Gaussian limiting distribution. These results hold uniformly over the class of precision matrices with row sparsity of small order (Formula presented.) and spectrum uniformly bounded, under a sub-Gaussian tail assumption on the margins of the true underlying distribution. Consequently, our results lead to uniformly valid confidence regions for low-dimensional parameters of the precision matrix. Thresholding the estimator leads to variable selection without imposing irrepresentability conditions. The performance of the method is demonstrated in a simulation study and on real data. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Asymptotic normality; Confidence regions; Inference; Precision matrix; Sparsity,,,English,Article in Press

However, up to date, no test of equality of one or more MCVs has been developed in the literature. In this paper, several classical and robust Wald-type tests are proposed and studied. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics are derived under elliptical symmetry, and the asymptotic efficiency of the robust versions is compared to the classical tests. Robustness of the proposed procedures is examined through partial and joint influence functions of the test statistic, as well as by means of power and level influence functions. A simulation study compares the performance of the classical and robust tests under uncontaminated and contaminated schemes, and the difference with the usual covariance homogeneity test is highlighted. As a by-product, these tests may also be considered in the univariate context where they yield procedures that are both robust and easy-to-use. They provide an interesting alternative to the numerous parametric tests existing in the literature, which are, in most cases, unreliable in presence of outliers. The methods are illustrated on a real data set. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",External quality assessment; Multivariate coefficient of variation; Robust testing; Wald-type test,,,English,Article in Press

A profile generalized estimating equations (GEE)-based approach is proposed to estimate unknown regression parameters. Within a wide range of bandwidths for estimating the nonparametric function, our profile GEE estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal even if the covariance structure is misspecified. Moreover, if the covariance structure is correctly specified, the semiparametric efficiency can be achieved under heteroscedasticity and without distributional assumptions on the covariates. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed procedure. The proposed methodology is further illustrated through a data analysis. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Generalized estimating equations; Generalized partially single-index models;

To better account for model uncertainty, we propose an objective Bayesian approach to follow-up designs, using prior distributions suitably tailored to model selection. To select the best follow-up runs, we adopt a model discrimination criterion based on a weighted average of Kullback–Leibler divergences between predictive distributions for all possible pairs of models. Our procedure should appeal to practitioners because it does not require prior specifications, being fully automatic. When applied to real data, it produces follow-up runs which better discriminate among factors relative to current methodology. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian design of experiments; Bayesian model selection; Kullback–Leibler divergence; Non-informative prior; Screening experiment,,"Abramowitz, M., Stegun, I.A., Handbook of mathematical functions with formulas, graphs, and mathematical tables.

This proposed procedure is based on ranks of real-valued linear functions of multivariate observations. The linear function used to rank the observations is obtained by solving a classification problem between the two multivariate distributions from which the observations are generated. Our proposed tests retain the distribution-free property of their univariate analogs, and they perform well for high-dimensional data even when the dimension exceeds the sample size. Asymptotic results on their power properties are derived when the dimension grows to infinity and the sample size may or may not grow with the dimension. We analyze several high-dimensional simulated and real data sets to compare the empirical performance of our proposed tests with several other tests available in the literature. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Distance-weighted discrimination;

Only the sample (Yi) is observed. We study nonparametric estimators of both the density f and the corresponding survival function F¯. First, kernel estimators are built. Pointwise risk bounds for the quadratic risk are given, and upper and lower bounds for the rates in this setting are provided. Then, in a global setting, a data-driven bandwidth selection procedure is proposed. The resulting estimator has been proved to be adaptive in the sense that its risk automatically realizes the bias-variance compromise. Second, when the Xis are nonnegative, using kernels fitted for R+-supported functions, we propose new estimators of the survival function which are also adaptive.

Among the available procedures for fitting generalized linear models, the method of moments (MM) and the penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) method are employed. The empirical best predictor (EBP) of the area mean is derived using MM and compared with plug-in alternatives using MM and PQL. The plug-in estimator using PQL is computationally faster and provides competitive performance with respect to EBP that involves high complex integrals. An approximation to the mean squared error (MSE) of the EBP is given and three MSE estimators are proposed. The first two MSE estimators are plug-in estimators without and with bias correction to the second order and the third one is based on parametric bootstrap. Several simulation experiments are carried out for analysing the behaviour of the EBP and for comparing the estimators of the MSE of the EBP. A good choice in practice is the bootstrap alternative since it performs similarly to the analytical versions and is computationally faster. The developed methodology and software are applied to data from the 2008 Spanish living condition survey. The target of the application is the estimation of poverty rates at province level. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bootstrap; Empirical best predictor; Mean squared error; Method of moments; Poisson mixed models; Poverty,,"Breslow, N.E., Clayton, D.G., Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models (1993) J Am Stat Assoc, 88, pp. 9-25; Datta, G.S., Lahiri, P., A unified measure of uncertainty of estimated best linear unbiased predictors in small area estimation problems (2000) Stat Sinica, 10, pp. 613-627; Esteban, M.D., Morales, D., Pérez, A., Santamaría, L., Small area estimation of poverty proportions under area-level time models (2012) Comput Stat Data Anal, 56, pp. 2840-2855; Fay, R.E., Herriot, R.A., Estimation of income from small places: an application of James–Stein procedures to census data (1979) J Am Stat Assoc, 74, pp. 269-277; Ghosh, M., Rao, J.N.K., Small area estimation: an appraisal (with discussion) (1994) Stat Sci, 9, pp. 55-93; González-Manteiga, W., Lombardía, M.J., Molina, I., Morales, D., Santamaría, L., Estimation of the mean squared error of predictors of small area linear parameters under a logistic mixed model (2007) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51, pp. 2720-2733; González-Manteiga, W., Lombardía, M.J., Molina, I., Morales, D., Santamaría, L., Bootstrap mean squared error of small-area EBLUP (2008) J Stat Comput Simul, 78, pp. 443-462; González-Manteiga, W., Lombardía, M.J., Molina, I., Morales, D., Santamaría, L., Analytic and bootstrap approximations of prediction errors under a multivariate Fay–Herriot model (2008) Comput Stat Data Anal, 52, pp. 5242-5252; Jiang, J., Consistent estimators in generalized linear models (1998) J Am Stat Assoc, 93, pp. 720-729; Jiang, J., Empirical best prediction for small-area inference based on generalized linear mixed models (2003) J Stat Plan Inference, 111, pp. 117-127; Jiang, J., Lahiri, P., Empirical best prediction for small area inference with binary data (2001) A Inst Stat Math, 53, pp. 217-243; Jiang, J., Lahiri, P., Mixed model prediction and small area estimation (2006) Test, 15, pp. 1-96; Johnson, F.A., Chandra, H., Brown, J., Padmadas, S., Estimating district-level births attended by skilled attendants in Ghana using demographic health survey and census data: An application of small area estimation technique (2010) J Off Stat, 26 (2), pp. 341-359; Lahiri, S.N., Maiti, T., Katzoff, M., Parsons, V., Resampling-based empirical prediction: an application to small area estimation (2007) Biometrika, 94, pp. 469-485; Lin, X., Estimation using penalized quasilikelihood and quasi-pseudolikelihood in poisson mixed models (2007) Lifetime Data Anal, 13, pp. 533-544; López-Vizcaíno, E., Lombardía, M.J., Morales, D., Multinomial-based small area estimation of labour force indicators (2013) Stat Model, 13, pp. 153-178; López-Vizcaíno, E., Lombardía, M.J., Morales, D., Small area estimation of labour force indicators under a multinomial model with correlated time and area effects (2015) J R Stat Soc Ser A, 178, pp. 535-565; MacNab, Y.C., Lin, X., On empirical bayes penalized quasi-likelihood inference in GLMMs and in Bayesian disease mapping and ecological modelling (2009) Comput Stat Data Anal, 53, pp. 2950-2967; Pfeffermann, D., Small area estimation—new developments and directions (2002) Int Stat Rev, 70, pp. 125-143; Pfeffermann, D., New important developments in small area estimation (2013) Stat Sci, 28, pp. 40-68; Prasad, N.G.N., Rao, J.N.K., The estimation of the mean squared error of small-area estimators (1990) J Am Stat Assoc, 85, pp. 163-171; Rao, J.N.K., Some recent advances in model-based small area estimation (1999) Surv Methodol, 25, pp. 175-186; Rao, J.N.K., (2003) Small area estimation, , Wiley, New York; Rao, J.N.K., Some methods for small area estimation (2008) Riv Intern Sci Soc, 4, pp. 387-406; Saei, A., Chambers, R., Small area estimation under linear and generalized linear mixed models with time and area effects (2003) Methodology working paper, 1000 (15). , Southampton Statistical Sciences Research Institute, University of Southampton, UK; Särndal, C., Swensson, B., Wretman, J., (1992) Model assisted survey sampling, , Springer, Berlin",English,Article

This work addresses the problem of how to assess and manage product returns costs using a risk analysis methodology. Online product returns are seen as a random phenomenon that fluctuates in severity over time, threatening the profitability of the online store. Therefore, the starting point is that this risk can be modeled as a future random stream of payments. Given one or many future time periods, we aim to assess and manage this risk by answering two important questions: (1) Pricing—or what dollar amount factored on top of the current price of goods sold online would cover the cost of product returns, and (2) Reserving—or how much capital does an online retailer need to reserve at the beginning of each period to cover the cost of online product returns. We develop our analysis for one period (a month) by a closed formula model, and for multi-period (a year) by a dynamic simulation model. Risk measurements are executed in both cases to answer the two main questions above. We exemplify this methodology using an anonymized archival database of actual purchase and return history provided by a large size US women’s apparel online retailer. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",E-commerce; Online product return; Risk analysis; Risk management; Simulation,,,English,Article in Press

Specifically, we assume that the null distribution is symmetric about zero, while the true effects have positive median. We then suggest two new tests for this purpose. The main one is a form of Anderson–Darling test for symmetry and is closely related to the higher criticism. It is shown to achieve the detection boundary for the normal mixture model and, more generally, for asymptotically generalized Gaussian mixture models, in all sparsity regimes. The other test is a form of longest run test and specifically designed for the very sparse situation. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Anderson–Darling test; Distribution-free tests; Higher criticism; Mixture detection; Smirnov test for symmetry,,,English,Article in Press

In addition, the customers become impatient when the system is down. The customers arrive according to a Poisson process and service time follows exponential distribution. Each customer requires exactly one server for its service and the customers select the servers on fastest server first basis. Explicit expressions are derived for the time-dependent system size probabilities in terms of the modified Bessel function, by employing the generating function along with continued fraction and the identity of the confluent hypergeometric function. Further, the steady-state probabilities of the number of customers in the system are deduced and finally some important performance measures are obtained. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Confluent hypergeometric function; Customers’ impatience; Heterogeneous servers; Moments; Performance measures; Server repair; Steady-state probabilities; System disaster,,,English,Article in Press

In this paper, we describe a new deterministic iterated local search algorithm, which is tested using a large number of benchmark problems chosen from the literature. These computational tests have proven that this algorithm competes with the best known algorithms in terms of the quality of the solutions and at the same time, it is simpler and faster. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Backhauls; Iterated local search; Linehauls; Logistics; Vehicle routing,,"Battarra, M., Cordeau, J.-F., Iori, M., Toth, P., Vigo, D., Pickup-and-delivery problems for goods transportation (2014) Vehicle routing: problems, methods, and applications.

As its single objective counterpart, it also requires an external penalty function for the constraint set, as well as an exogenous divergent sequence of nonnegative real numbers, the so-called penalty parameters, but, differently from the scalar procedure, the vector-valued method uses an auxiliary function, which can be chosen among large classes of “monotonic” real-valued mappings. We analyze the properties of the auxiliary functions in those classes and exhibit some examples. The convergence results are similar to those of the scalar-valued method, and depending on the kind of auxiliary function used in the implementation, under standard assumptions, the generated infeasible sequences converge to weak Pareto or Pareto optimal points. We also propose an implementable local version of the external penalization method and study its convergence results. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Constrained multiobjective optimization; External penalty method; Pareto optimality; Scalar representation,,"Bonnel, H., Iusem, A.N., Svaiter, B.F., Proximal methods in vector optimization (2005) SIAM J Optim, 15 (4), pp. 953-970; Carrizosa, E., Frenk, J.B.G., Dominating sets for convex functions with some applications (1998) J Optim Theory Appl, 96 (2), pp. 281-295; Eschenauer, H., Koski, J., Osyczka, A., (1990) Multicriteria design optimization, , Springer, Berlin; Fliege, J., Graña Drummond, L.M., Svaiter, B.F., Newton’s method for multiobjective optimization (2009) SIAM J Optim, 20 (2), pp. 602-626; Fliege, J., Svaiter, B.F., Steepest descent methods for multicriteria optimization (2000) Math Methods Oper Res, 51 (3), pp. 479-494; Fu, Y., Diwekar, U., An efficient sampling approach to multiobjective optimization (2004) Ann Oper Res, 132 (1-4), pp. 109-134; Fukuda, E.H., Graña Drummond, L.M., On the convergence of the projected gradient method for vector optimization (2011) Optimization, 60 (8-9), pp. 1009-1021; Fukuda, E.H., Graña Drummond, L.M., Inexact projected gradient method for vector optimization (2013) Comput Optim Appl, 54 (3), pp. 473-493; Graña Drummond, L.M., Iusem, A.N., A projected gradient method for vector optimization problems (2004) Comput Optim Appl, 28 (1), pp. 5-29; Graña Drummond, L.M., Raupp, F.M.P., Svaiter, B.F., A quadratically convergent Newton method for vector optimization (2014) Optimization, 63 (5), pp. 661-677; Graña Drummond, L.M., Svaiter, B.F., A steepest descent method for vector optimization (2005) J Comput Appl Math, 175 (2), pp. 395-414; Gravel, M., Martel, J.R., Price, W., Tremblay, R., A multicriterion view of optimal ressource allocation in job-shop production (1992) Eur J Oper Res, 61, pp. 230-244; Jahn, J., Vector optimization—theory, applications (2003) and extensions, , Springer, Erlangen; Leschine, T.M., Wallenius, H., Verdini, W., Interactive multiobjective analysis and assimilative capacity-based ocean disposal decisions (1992) Eur J Oper Res, 56, pp. 278-289; Luc, D.T., Theory of vector optimization (1989) Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems, p. 319. , Springer, Berlin; Luenberger, D.G., (2003) Linear and nonlinear programming, , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston; Tavana, M., A subjective assessment of alternative mission architectures for the human exploration of mars at NASA using multicriteria decision making (2004) Comput Oper Res, 31, pp. 1147-1164; White, D.J., Multiobjective programming and penalty functions (1984) J Optim Theory Appl, 43 (4), pp. 583-599; White, D.J., Epsilon-dominating solutions in mean-variance portfolio analysis (1998) Eur J Oper Res, 105, pp. 457-466; Zangwill, W.I., Non-linear programming via penalty functions (1967) Manag Sci, 13 (5), pp. 344-358",English,Article

The objective is to minimize the difference between the total connection cost and total revenue. The problem is a generalization of the problem studied in Gouveia and Pires (Eur J Oper Res 133:21–31, 2001a) and it can also be seen as a combination of variants of two NP-Hard problems, the vehicle routing problem and the maximum edge-weighted clique problem. We introduce and discuss two types of integer linear programming formulations and propose some valid inequalities to strengthen the linear programming relaxation. Computational results are presented to evaluate the quality of the linear programming relaxation bounds associated with these formulations as well as efficiency of the models to obtain the optimal integer solutions. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Integer linear programming; Network design; Valid inequalities,,"Baldacci, R., Dell’Amico, M., Heuristic algorithms for the multi-depot ring-star problem (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 203, pp. 270-281; Baldacci, R., Dell’Amico, M., Salazar González, J., The capacitated M-ring-star problem (2007) Ope Res, 55, pp. 1147-1162; Berinsky, H., Zabala, P., An integer linear programming formulation and branch-and-cut algorithm for the capacitated M-ring-star problem (2011) Electr Notes Discret Math, 37, pp. 273-278; Carroll, P., Fortz, B., Labbé, M., McGarraghy, S., A branch-and-cut algorithm for the ring spur assignment problem (2013) Networks, 61 (2), pp. 89-103; Carroll, P., Fortz, B., Labbé, M., McGarraghy, S., Pahl, J., Reiners, T., Voss, S., Improved formulations for the ring spur assignment problem (2011) of Lecture notes in computer science, 6701, pp. 24-36. , Springer, Berlin; Câmpelo, M., Campos, V.A., Corrêa, R.C., On the asymmetric representatives formulations for the vertex coloring problem (2008) Discret Appl Math, 156, pp. 1097-1111; Desrochers, M., Laporte, G., Improvements to the Miller–Tucker–Zemlin subtour elimination constraints (1991) Oper Res Lett, 10, pp. 27-36; Gendreau, M., Labbé, M., Laporte, G., Efficient heuristics for the design of ring networks (1995) Telecommun Syst, 4, pp. 177-188; Gouveia, L., Pesneau, P., On extend formulations for the precedence constrained asymmetric travelling salesman problem (2006) Networks, 48, pp. 77-89; Gouveia, L., Pires, J., Models for a Steiner ring network design problem with revenues (2001) Eur J Oper Res, 133, pp. 21-31; Gouveia, L., Pires, J., The Asymmetric travelling salesman problem: on generalizations of disaggregated of Miller–Tucker–Zemlin constraints (2001) Discret Appl Math, 112, pp. 129-145; Gouveia, L., Pires, J., The asymmetric travelling salesman problem and a reformulation of the Miller–Tucker–Zemlin constraints (1999) Eur J Oper Res, 112, pp. 134-146; Klincewicz, J., Luss, H., Yan, D., Designing tributary networks with multiple ring families (1998) Comput Oper Res, 25, pp. 1145-1157; Labbé, M., Laporte, G., Rodríguez Martín, I., Salazar González, J., The ring star problem: polyhedral analysis and exact algorithm (2004) Networks, 43, pp. 177-189; Naji-Azimi, Z., Salari, M., Toth, P., An integer linear programming based heuristic for the capacitated M-ring-star problem (2012) Eur J Oper Res, 217, pp. 17-25; Naji-Azimi, Z., Salari, M., Toth, P., A heuristic procedure for the capacitated M-ring-star problem (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 207, pp. 1227-1234; Pires, J.M., (2001) Formulações Para O Problema Do Caixeiro Viajante Assimétrico E Sua Aplicação a Um Problema De Desenho De Redes Com Topologia Em Forma De Anel, , Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa: Departamento de Estatística e Investigação Operacional; Sarin, S.C., Sherali, H.D., Bhootra, A., New tighter polynomial length formulations for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with and without precedence constraints (2005) Oper Res Lett, 33, pp. 62-70; Sherali, H., Sarin, S., Tsai, P., A class of lifted path and flow-based formulations for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem with and without precedence constraints (2006) Discret Optim, 3, pp. 20-32; Toth, P., The vehicle routing problem, vol 9 of SIAM monographs on discrete mathematics and applications, chapter 1.

Our formulation is different from the standard formulations in explicitly modeling component flows. Modeling the physical components directly, allows easy inclusion of processing facilities that may alter the flow composition. It also allows adding composite quality constraints that cannot be added directly as quality parameters as they do not blend linearly. We provide new test instances motivated by natural gas transport problems at the Norwegian Continental Shelf and give computational results. We show examples of nonlinear composite constraints on quality attributes and give computational results on the effect of adding such constraints to the new set of test instances. The increased flexibility of our formulation comes at the cost of less tight constraints and a performance penalty on existing test cases in literature. The advantage is that it can solve the more general test cases described above. We use GAMS implementations of the various formulations and solve the problems with BARON. We compare the performance of our bilinear formulation in BARON with discretizations solved as a Mixed Integer Linear Program using CPLEX. The discretized versions do not generally perform as well as the continuous model; however, they have better worst-case behavior on the new test cases. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Discretizations; Global optimization; Natural gas; Pooling problems,,"Adhya, N., Tawarmalani, M., Sahinidis, N., A Lagrangian approach to the pooling problem (1999) Ind Eng Chem Res, 38 (5), pp. 1956-1972; Alfaki, M., Haugland, D., A multi-commodity flow formulation for the generalized pooling problem (2013) J Global Optim, 56, pp. 917-937; Alfaki, M., Haugland, D., Strong formulations for the pooling problem (2013) J Global Optim, 56 (3), pp. 897-916; Androulakis, I., Maranas, C., Floudas, C., α bb: a global optimization method for general constrained nonconvex problems (1995) J Global Optim, 7 (4), pp. 337-363; Audet, C., Hansen, P., Jaumard, B., Savard, G., A branch and cut algorithm for nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (2000) Math Program, 87 (1), pp. 131-152; Audet, C., Brimberg, J., Hansen, P., Le Digabel, S., Mladenović, N., Pooling problem: alternate formulations and solution methods (2004) Manag Sci, 50, pp. 761-776; Baker, T., Lasdon, L., Successive linear programming at Exxon (1985) Manag Sci, 31, pp. 264-274; Ben-Tal, A., Eiger, G., Gershovitz, V., Global minimization by reducing the duality gap (1994) Math Program, 63 (1), pp. 193-212; Castro, P.M., Teles, J.P., Comparison of global optimization algorithms for the design of water-using networks (2013) Comput Chem Eng, 52, pp. 249-261; Dey, S.S., Gupte, A., Analysis of MILP techniques for the pooling problem (2015) Oper Res, 62 (2), pp. 412-427; Fodstad, M., Midthun, K.T., Tomasgard, A., Adding flexibility in a natural gas transportation network using interruptible transportation services (2015) Eur J Oper Res, 243 (2), pp. 647-657; Foulds, L.R., Haugland, D., Jørnsten, K., A bilinear approach to the pooling problem (1992) Optimization, 24, pp. 165-180; Frimannslund, L., Haugland D (2009) Parallel solution of the pooling problem with application to the cell broadband engine architecture (2009) engineering, 2009, pp. 354-359. , CIE: IEEE; Gounaris, C., Misener, R., Floudas, C., Computational comparison of piecewise-linear relaxations for pooling problems (2009) Ind Eng Chem Res, 48 (12), pp. 5742-5766; Gupte, A., Mixed integer bilinear programming with applications to the pooling problem.

Given a set of flights and their configurations, the aim of the problem was to provide new configurations such that all conflict situations are avoided, with conflict situation understood to mean an event in which two or more aircraft violate the minimum safety distances that must be maintained in flight. The proposed model solves the problem using both horizontal (velocity and angle turn change) and vertical (altitude level change) maneuvers. As a special case, another model is presented in which only horizontal maneuvers are used. The models proposed are based on a geometric construction which involves trigonometric functions, so the constraint system is included via a large set of trigonometric and nonconvex inequalities. A multicriteria approach is presented to provide useful information to air traffic control officers about the maneuvers to be performed. The main results of an extensive computational experiment are reported in which the performance of the state-of-the-art nonconvex MINO solver Minotaur is studied. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Air traffic management; Collision avoidance problem; Goal programming; Mixed 0–1 nonlinear optimization; Multicriteria functions,,"Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., Collision avoidance in the air traffic management: a mixed integer linear optimization approach (2011) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 12 (1), pp. 47-57; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., A mixed 0–1 nonlinear optimization model and algorithmic approach for the collision avoidance in ATM: velocity changes through a time horizon (2012) Comput Oper Res, 12 (39), pp. 3136-3146; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Olaso, P., Pizarro, C., Conflict avoidance: 0–1 linear models for conflict detection & resolution (2013) TOP, 21 (3), pp. 485-504; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., Exact and approximate solving of the aircraft collision resolution problem by turn changes (2014) Transp Sci; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., On modeling the air traffic control coordination in the collision avoidance problem by mixed integer linear optimization (2014) Ann Oper Res, 1 (222), pp. 89-105; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., Mladenović, N., A VNS metaheuristic for solving the aircraft conflict detection and resolution problem by performing turn changes (2014) J Glob Optim; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escuedro, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., Multiobjective optimization for aircraft conflict resolution (2015), A metaheuristic approach, Eur J Oper ResBonini, D., Dupré, C., In: Proceedings of the 7th international conference on computing (2009) communications and control technologies, , Orlando: USA; Cafieri, S., Durand, N., Aircraft deconfliction with speed regulation: new models from mixed-integer optimization (2013) J Glob Optim; Cetek, C., Realistic speed change maneuvers for air traffic conflict avoidance and their impact on aircraft economics (2009) Int J Civ Aviat, 1 (1), pp. 62-73; Chankong, V., Haimes, Y., (1983) Multiobjective decision making: theory and methodology, , North-Holland, New York; Charnes, A., Cooper, W., Ferguson, R., Optimal estimation of executive compensation by linear programming (1955) Manag Sci, 1 (2), pp. 138-151; Christodoulou, M.A., Costoulakis, C., Nonlinear mixed integer programming for aircraft collision avoidance in free flight (2004) IEEE Melecon 2004, Dubrovnik, Croacia, 1, pp. 327-330; Cochrane, J., Zeleny, M., (1973) Multiple criteria decision making, , University of South Carolina Press, Columbia; Cohon, J., (1978) Multiobjective programming and planning, , Academic Press, New York; Dell’Olmo, P., Lulli, G., A new hierarchical architecture for air traffic management: optimization of airway capacity in a free flight scenario (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 144, pp. 179-193; Durand, N., Alliot, J., Mèdioni, F., Neural nets trained by genetic algorithms for collision avoidance (2000) Appl Intell, 13, pp. 205-213; Escudero, L., Zenios, S.A., Robust portfolios for mortgage-backed securities (1995) Quantitative methods, AI and supercomputers in finance, pp. 201-228. , Unicom, London; Eurocontrol long-term forecast: IFR flight 2010–2030 (2010), Technical report, Eurocontrol-Air Traffic Statistics and ForecastFrazzoli, E., Mao, Z.H., Oh, J.H., Feron, E., Resolution of conflicts involving many aircraft via semidefinite programming (2001) AIAA J Guid Control Dyn, 24 (1), pp. 79-86; Ignizio, J., (1985) Introduction to linear goal programming, , Sage Publishing, Beverly Hills; Jardin, M.R., Toward real-time en route air traffic control optimization.

In the pc-tsp, we are given a weighted graph G= (V, E) with edge weights ℓ: E→ R+, a special vertex r∈ V, penalties π: V→ R+ and the goal is to find a closed tour K such that r∈ V(K) and such that the cost ℓ(K) + π(V\ V(K)) , which is the sum of the weights of the edges in the tour and the cost of the vertices not spanned by K, is minimized. In this paper, we study the pc-tsp from a viewpoint of robust optimization. In our setting, an operator must find a closed tour in a (known) edge-weighted tree T= (V, E) starting and ending in the depot r while some of the edges may be blocked by “avalanches” defining the scenario ξ. The cost f(K, ξ) of a tour K in scenario ξ is the cost resulting from “shortcutting” K, i.e. from restricting K to the nodes which are reachable from r in scenario ξ, i.e. in the graph T\ ξ= (V, E\ ξ). In the absolute robust version of the problem one searches for a tour which minimizes the worst-case cost over all scenarios, while in the deviation robust counterpart, the regret, that is, the deviation from an optimum solution for a particular scenario, is sought to be minimized. We show that both versions of the problem can be solved in polynomial time on trees. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Dynamic programming; Prize collecting traveling salesman problem; Robust optimization; Routing problem; Uncertainty,,"Archer, A., Bateni, M., Hajiaghayi, M., Karlow, H., Improved approximation algorithm for prize-collecting Steiner tree and TSP (2011) SIAM J Comput, 40 (2), pp. 309-332; Ausiello, G., Bonifaci, V., Leonardi, S., Marchetti-Spaccamela, A., Gonzalez, T., Prize-collecting traveling salesman and related problems (2007) Handbook of approximation algorithms and metaheuristics.

New customers enter the system according to a general independent arrival process, but the types of consecutive customers may be nonindependent. As a result, arriving customers may (or may not) have the tendency to cluster according to their types, which may lead to more (or less) blocking of one type by the opposite type. The paper reveals the impact of this blocking phenomenon on the achievable throughput, the (average) system content, the (average) customer delay and the (average) unfinished work. The paper extends the results of earlier work where either the service times were assumed to be constant and equal to 1 slot each, or the customers all belonged to the same class. Our results show that, in case of Poisson arrivals, for given traffic intensity, the system-content distribution is insensitive to the length (s) of the service times, but the (mean) delay and the (mean) unfinished work in the system are not. In case of bursty arrivals, we find that all the performance measures are affected by the length (s) of the service times, for given traffic intensity. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Blocking; Constant service times; Dedicated servers; Global FCFS; Queueing,,,English,Article in Press

Interestingly, without involving non-parametric approach, we show that the directions of all the index parameter vectors can be recovered by a simple linear composite quantile regression (CQR). As a specific application, a iterative-free CQR estimation procedure for the partially linear single-index model is proposed. Furthermore, it can also be used to develop a penalized CQR procedure for variable selection in the high-dimensional settings. The new method has superiority in robustness and efficiency by inheriting the advantage of the CQR approach. Simulation results and real-data analysis also confirm our method. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",High dimensionality; Index estimation; Multiple-index models; Robust; Variable selection,,,English,Article in Press

However, this marginal Person correlation learning would easily miss the variable that is marginally uncorrelated with the response but correlated with the response jointly with some other variables. This failure in missing an important variable is due to the fact that the marginal Pearson correlation does not use the joint information of the response and a set of covariates. In this paper, we introduce a new screening method which leaves a variable into the active set if it jointly with some other variables has a high canonical correlation with the response. This is accomplished via ranking canonical correlations between the response and all possible sets of k variables. Our results show that the procedure has the sure screening property and substantially reduces the dimensionality to a moderate size against the sample size. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our new method performs substantially better than the existing sure independence screening approaches based on the marginal Pearson correlation or Kental’s tau rank correlation. A real data set is also analyzed by implementing our approach. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Correlation; Group screening; High dimension,,,English,Article in Press

The present article reviews the most recent theoretical and methodological developments for random forests. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical forces driving the algorithm, with special attention given to the selection of parameters, the resampling mechanism, and variable importance measures. This review is intended to provide non-experts easy access to the main ideas. © 2016, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Parameter tuning; Random forests; Randomization; Resampling; Variable importance,,"Amaratunga, D., Cabrera, J., Lee, Y.-S., Enriched random forests (2008) Bioinformatics, 24, pp. 2010-2014; Amit, Y., Geman, D., Shape quantization and recognition with randomized trees (1997) Neural Comput, 9, pp. 1545-1588; Archer, K.J., Kimes, R.V., Empirical characterization of random forest variable importance measures (2008) Comput Stat Data Anal, 52, pp. 2249-2260; Arlot, S., Genuer, R., (2014) Analysis of purely random forests bias. arXiv, 1407, p. 3939. , arXiv:1407.3939; Auret, L., Aldrich, C., Empirical comparison of tree ensemble variable importance measures (2011) Chemom Intell Lab Syst, 105, pp. 157-170; Bai, Z.-H., Devroye, L., Hwang, H.-K., Tsai, T.-H., Maxima in hypercubes (2005) Random Struct Algorithms, 27, pp. 290-309; Banerjee, M., McKeague, I.W., Confidence sets for split points in decision trees (2007) Ann Stat, 35, pp. 543-574; Barndorff-Nielsen, O., Sobel, M., On the distribution of the number of admissible points in a vector random sample (1966) Theory Probab Appl, 11, pp. 249-269; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for AI (2009) Found Trends Mach Learn, 2, pp. 1-127; Bernard, S., Heutte, L., Adam, S., Forest-RK: a new random forest induction method (2008) Advanced intelligent computing theories and applications.

The existing recommendations are only applicable for small sample sizes. The implementation of exhaustive search techniques for large sample sizes is not feasible in practice. In this article, a meta-heuristic algorithm based on variable neighborhood search approach is proposed for large sample sizes. It is found that the algorithm gives exactly the same solution for small sample sizes as the solution obtained in an exhaustive search; however, for large sample sizes, it gives near-optimum solution. We have proposed a cost function-based optimum criterion, which is scale invariant for location-scale and log-location-scale families of distribution. A sensitivity analysis is also considered to study the effect of misspecification of parameter values or cost coefficients on the optimum solution. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cost function; Information matrix; Meta-heuristic algorithm; Near-optimum solution; Quantile; Scale invariant; Sensitivity analysis,,"Balakrishnan, N., Progressive censoring methodology: an appraisal (2007) Test, 16, pp. 211-259; Balakrishnan, N., Burkschat, M., Cramer, E., Hofmann, G., Fisher information based progressive censoring plans (2008) Comput Stat Data Anal, 53, pp. 366-380; Balakrishnan, N., Aggarwala, R., (2000) Progressive censoring: theory, methods, and applications, , Birkhauser, Boston; Balakrishnan, N., Cramer, E., (2014) The art of progressive censoring: application to reliability and quality, , Birkhauser, New York; http://www.isical.ac.in/~sqcorkol/blog/?page_id=18, Bhattacharya R, Pradhan B, Dewanji A (2014a) On optimum life testing plans under Type-II progressive censoring scheme via variable neighborhood search algorithm.

Quite often such real data contain a significant number of outliers in relation to the standard parametric model used in the analysis; in such cases inference based on the maximum likelihood estimator could be unreliable. In this paper, we develop a robust estimation procedure for the generalized linear models that can generate robust estimators with little loss in efficiency.

In this work we present a proposal to deal with these issues simultaneously in the context of the mixture regression by extending the classic normal model by assuming that the random errors follow a scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions. This approach allows us to model data with great flexibility, accommodating skewness and heavy tails. The main virtue of considering the mixture regression models under the class of scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions is that they have a nice hierarchical representation which allows easy implementation of inference. We develop a simple EM-type algorithm to perform maximum likelihood inference of the parameters of the proposed model. In order to examine the robust aspect of this flexible model against outlying observations, some simulation studies are also presented. Finally, a real data set is analyzed, illustrating the usefulness of the proposed method. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",EM algorithm; Finite mixtures of regression models; Scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions,,"Andrews, D.F., Mallows, C.L., Scale mixtures of normal distributions (1974) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 36, pp. 99-102; Arellano-Valle, R.B., Castro, L.M., Genton, M.G., Gómez, H.W., Bayesian inference for shape mixtures of skewed distributions, with application to regression analysis (2008) Bayesian Anal, 3 (3), pp. 513-539; Azzalini, A., A class of distributions which includes the normal ones (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Azzalini, A., Capitanio, A., Distributions generated and perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on the multivariate skew-t distribution (2003) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 61, pp. 367-389; Bai, X., Yao, W., Boyer, J.E., Robust fitting of mixture regression models (2012) Comput Stat Data Anal, 56, pp. 2347-2359; Basso, R.M., Lachos, V.H., Cabral, C.R.B., Ghosh, P., Robust mixture modeling based on scale mixtures of skew-normal distributions (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 2926-2941; Böhning, D., Computer-assisted analysis of mixtures and applications.

We assume that {Λθ: θ∈ Θ} is a parametric family of strictly increasing functions, while m is an unknown regression function. The goal of the paper is to develop tests for the null hypothesis that m(·) belongs to a certain parametric family of regression functions. We propose a Kolmogorov–Smirnov and a Cramér–von Mises type test statistic, which measure the distance between the distribution of ε estimated under the null hypothesis and the distribution of ε without making use of this null hypothesis. The estimated distributions are based on a profile likelihood estimator of θ and a local polynomial estimator of m(·). The limiting distributions of these two test statistics are established under the null hypothesis and under a local alternative. We use a bootstrap procedure to approximate the critical values of the test statistics under the null hypothesis. Finally, a simulation study is carried out to illustrate the performance of our testing procedures, and we apply our tests to data on the scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bootstrap; Goodness-of-fit; Local polynomial smoothing; Profile likelihood; Semiparametric regression; Transformation model,,"Akritas, M.G., Van Keilegom, I., Nonparametric estimation of the residual distribution (2001) Scand J Stat, 28, pp. 549-568; Bellver, C., Influence of particulate pollution on the positions of neutral points in the sky in Seville (Spain) (1987) Atmos Environ, 21, pp. 699-702; Bickel, P.J., Doksum, K., An analysis of transformations revisited (1981) J Am Stat Assoc, 76, pp. 296-311; Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An analysis of transformations (1964) J R Stat Soc, 26, pp. 211-252; Carroll, R.J., Ruppert, D., (1988) Transformation and weighting in regression, , Chapman and Hall, New York; Cleveland, W.S., (1993) Visualizing data, , Hobart Press, Summit; Colling B, Heuchenne C, Samb R, Van Keilegom I (2013) Estimation of the error density in a semiparametric transformation model.

The objectives are to minimize both the closest and barrier distances. The closest distance represents the accessibility of customers, whereas the barrier distance represents the interference to travelers. The distributions of the closest and barrier distances are derived for a rectangular facility in a rectangular city where the distance is measured as the rectilinear distance. The analytical expressions for the distributions demonstrate how the location, size, and shape of the facility affect the closest and barrier distances. A numerical example shows that there exists a trade-off between the closest and barrier distances. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",Barrier distance; Closest distance; Location; Pareto optimal; Rectilinear distance,,,English,Article in Press

The external shocks occur according to a Bernoulli process, i.e., the inter-arrival times between two consecutive shocks follow a geometric distribution. Once the system fails, it can be repaired immediately. If the system is not repairable in a pre-specific time D, it can be replaced by a new one to avoid the unnecessary expanses on repair. On the other hand, the system can also be replaced whenever its number of repairs exceeds N. Given that infinite operating and repair times are not commonly encountered in practical situations, both of these two random variables are supposed to obey general discrete distribution with finite support. Replacing the finite support renewal distributions with appropriate phase-type (PH) distributions and using the closure property associated with PH distribution, we formulate the maximum repair time replacement policy and obtain analytically the long-run average cost rate. Meanwhile, the optimal replacement policy is also numerically determined by implementing a two-dimensional-search process. © 2016 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa",$$\delta $$δshock and wear model; Average cost rate; Finite support; Maximum repair time; Phase-type distribution,,,English,Article in Press

Hence, this paper mathematically formulates the model for the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling with material ordering (MRCPSMO) problem. In order to be more realistic, bonus and penalty policies are included for the project. The objective function of the model consists of four elements: the material holding cost, the material ordering cost, the bonus paid by the client and the cost of delay in the project completion. Since MRCPSMO is NP-hard, the paper proposes three hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms called PSO-GA, GA-GA and SA-GA to obtain near-optimal solutions. In addition, the design of experiments and Taguchi method is used to tune the algorithms’ parameters. The proposed algorithms consist of two components: an outside search, in which the algorithm searches for the best schedule and mode assignment, and the inside search, which determines the time and quantity of orders of the nonrenewable resources. First, a comparison is made for each individual component with the exact or best solutions available in the literature. Then, a set of standard PROGEN test problems is solved by the proposed hybrid algorithms under fixed CPU time.

The model assumes that there is a hierarchy between certain coalitions given by a partition. Face games (González-Díaz and Sánchez-Rodríguez in Games Econ Behav 62:100–105, 2008) play a central role in the definition of the proposed hierarchical game. It turns out that the Shapley value of the hierarchical game coincides with the Faigle and Kern precedence constraint value (Faigle and Kern in Int J Game Theory 21:249–266, 1992) and with some particular weighted Shapley value (Kalai and Samet in Int J Game Theory 16:205–222, 1987). Two new characterizations of this hierarchical value are given.

To analyze this extended problem, they propose the extreme and the diagonal approaches, both of them restricted to the case in which the reference vector is lower than the claims vector. We note that if the claims and the reference vectors are interchanged, the allocation proposed by the extreme approach varies.

We develop conditions, including an equivalent condition, under which glp optimal solutions exist. These results are fundamentally important to the ladder method for LSIP, which finds an optimal solution at a glp in the feasible region. For problems that do not have glp optimal solutions, we propose the addition of special artificial constraints to the constraint system of the problem to create a glp optimal solution. We present a ladder algorithm based on the maximum violation rule and an artificial ladder technique.

Prescribed burning is a management activity undertaken for the purposes of both wildfire hazard reduction and the preservation of fire-adapted ecosystems. Achievement of prescribed burn targets is made difficult by operational constraints such as limited personnel, equipment and suitable weather for undertaking burning. Prescribed burn program implementation may benefit from efficiencies gained in undertaking larger burns. Here, we present a mixed-integer programming formulation for aggregation of prescribed burn units. The model minimizes the total prescribed burn perimeter requiring management, by aggregating existing ‘fundamental’ burn units into larger compact and contiguous units or ‘clusters’. This problem is a special case of the ‘supervised regionalization’ or the ‘ (Formula presented.) -regions problem’. The model’s functionality is demonstrated on a test landscape and a number of extensions and implementation issues are discussed. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Clustering; Forest fire; Optimization; p-Regions; Prescribed fire,,"Acuna, M.A., Palma, C.D., Cui, W., Martell, D.L., Weintraub, A., Integrated spatial fire and forest management planning (2010) Can J For Res, 40 (12), pp. 2370-2383; Ager, A., Vaillant, N., Finney, M., A comparison of landscape fuel treatment strategies to mitigate wildland fire risk in the urban interface and preserve old forest structure (2010) For Ecol Manag, 259, pp. 1556-1570; Boer, M.M., Sadler, R.J., Wittkuhn, R.S., McCaw, L., Grierson, P.F., Long-term impacts of prescribed burning on regional extent and incidence of wildfires-evidence from 50 years of active fire management in SW Australian forests (2009) For Ecol Manag, 259 (1), pp. 132-142; Burrows, N., Linking fire ecology and fire management in south-west Australian forest landscapes (2008) For Ecol Manag, 255 (7), pp. 2394-2406; Calkin, D., Hummel, S., Agee, J., Modeling trade-offs between fire threat reduction and late-seral forest structure (2005) Can J For Res, 35 (11), pp. 2562-2574; Cheal, D., Growth stages and tolerable fire intervals for Victoria’s native vegetation data sets Fire and adaptive management report no. 84 (2010) In: Department of sustainability and environment, , Victorian Government Department of Sustainability and Environment, Melbourne; Collins, B.M., Stephens, S.L., Moghaddas, J.J., Battles, J., Challenges and approaches in planning fuel treatments across fire-excluded forested landscapes (2010) J For, 108 (1), pp. 24-31; Duque, J.C., Ramos, R., Suriñach, J., Supervised regionalization methods: a survey (2007) Int Reg Sci Rev, 30 (3), pp. 195-220; Duque, J.C., Church, R.L., Middleton, R.S., The p-regions problem (2011) Geograph Anal, 43 (1), pp. 104-126; Finney, M.A., Design of regular landscape fuel treatment patterns for modifying fire growth and behavior (2001) For Sci, 47 (2), pp. 219-228; Fischer, D.T., Church, R.L., Clustering and compactness in reserve site selection: an extension of the biodiversity management area selection model (2003) For Sci, 49 (4), pp. 555-565; González-Olabarria, J.R., Pukkala, T., Integrating fire risk considerations in landscape-level forest planning (2011) For Ecol Manag, 261 (2), pp. 278-287; Gonzalez, J., Palahi, M., Pukkala, T., Integrating fire risk considerations in forest management planning in Spain -A landscape level perspective (2005) Landscape Ecology, 20 (8), pp. 957-970; Haunert, J.-H., Wolff, A., Area aggregation in map generalisation by mixed-integer programming (2010) Int J Geograp Inf Sci, 24 (12), pp. 1871-1897; Hessburg, P., Reynolds, K., Keane, R., James, K., Salter, R., Evaluating wildland fire danger and prioritizing vegetation and fuels treatments (2007) For Ecol Manag, 247, pp. 1-17; Higgins, A., Whitten, S., Slijepcevic, A., Fogarty, L., Laredo, L., An optimisation modelling approach to seasonal resource allocation for planned burning (2011) Int J Wildland Fire, 20 (2), pp. 175-183; Hof, J., Omi, P., Bevers, M., Laven, R., A timing-oriented approach to spatial allocation of fire management effort (2000) For Sci, 46 (3), pp. 442-451; Kim, Y.-H., Bettinger, P., Effects of arranging forest fuel reduction treatments in spatial patterns on hypothetical, simulated, human-caused wildfires (2008) J Environ Sci Technol, 1 (4), pp. 187-200; Kim, Y., Bettinger, P., Finney, M., Spatial optimization of the pattern of fuel management activities and subsequent effects on simulated wildfires (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 197 (1), pp. 253-265; King, K.J., Bradstock, R.A., Cary, G.J., Chapman, J., Marsden-Smedley, J.B., The relative importance of fine-scale fuel mosaics on reducing fire risk in south-west Tasmania, Australia (2008) Int J Wildland Fire, 17 (3), pp. 421-430; Konoshima, M., Montgomery, C., Albers, H., Arthur, J., Spatial-endogenous fire risk and efficient fuel management and timber harvest (2008) Land Econ, 84 (3), pp. 449-468; Konoshima, M., Albers, H., Montgomery, C., Arthur, J., Optimal spatial patterns of fuel management and timber harvest with fire risk (2010) Can J For Res, 40 (1), pp. 95-108; Lehmkuhl, J., Kennedy, M., Ford, E., Singleton, P., Gaines, W., Lind, R., Seeing the forest for the fuel: integrating ecological values and fuels management (2007) For Ecol Manag, 246, pp. 73-80; Loehle, C., Applying landscape principles to fire hazard reduction (2004) For Ecol Manag, 198, pp. 261-267; McCaw, W.L., Managing forest fuels using prescribed fire—a perspective from southern Australia (2013) For Ecol Manag, 294, pp. 217-224; Minas, J., Hearne, J., Martell, D., An integrated optimization model for fuel management and fire suppression preparedness planning.

In this work, it is assumed that in each cycle, the rework process of all defective items starts when the regular production process finishes. After the rework process, a portion of reworked items fails. This portion becomes scrap and only the perfect finished items can be delivered to customers at the end of rework process. A profit function is derived to model the inventory problem and it is shown that the profit function is concave. Due to the complexity of the optimization problem, an algorithm is developed to determine the optimal values of manufacturing lot size and price such that the long-run average profit function is maximized. Furthermore, two special cases are identified and explained. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed inventory model. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Inventory; Lot size; Multiple shipments;

Due to limited number of facilities to be opened, some of the demand nodes may not be within full or partial coverage distance of a facility. However, a demand node that is not within the coverage distance of a facility should get service from the nearest facility within the shortest possible time. In this model, it is assumed that demand nodes within the predefined distance of opened facilities are fully covered, and after that distance the coverage level decreases linearly. The objectives are defined as the maximization of full and partial coverage, and the minimization of the maximum distance between uncovered demand nodes and their nearest facilities. We develop a new multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) called modified SPEA-II (mSPEA-II). In this method, the fitness function of SPEA-II is modified and the crowding distance of NSGA-II is used. The performance of mSPEA-II is tested on randomly generated problems of different sizes. The results are compared with the solutions of the most well-known MOGAs, NSGA-II and SPEA-II. Computational experiments show that mSPEA-II outperforms both NSGA-II and SPEA-II. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Facility location; Maximal coverage; Multi-objective genetic algorithm;

Liu S.-T.,A mathematical programming approach to sample coefficient of variation with interval-valued observations,2016,TOP,"","",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940702944&partnerID=40&md5=17da98cb8c98df279a0a69474c84e1c8,"The coefficient of variation is a useful statistical measure, which has long been widely used in many areas. In real-world applications, there are situations where the observations are inexact and imprecise in nature and they have to be estimated. This paper investigates the sample coefficient of variation (CV) with uncertain observations, which are represented by interval values. Since the observations are interval-valued, the derived CV should be interval-valued as well. A pair of mathematical programs is formulated to calculate the lower bound and upper bound of the CV. Originally, the pair of mathematical programs is nonlinear fractional programming problems, which do not guarantee to have global optimum solutions. By model reduction and variable substitutions, the mathematical programs are transformed into a pair of quadratic programs. Solving the pair of quadratic programs produces the global optimum solutions and constructs the interval of the CV. The given example shows that the proposed model is indeed able to help the manufacturer select the most suitable manufacturing process with interval-valued observations. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Interval-valued observation; Mathematical programming; Sample coefficient of variation,,"Almeida, C.W.D., Souza, R.M.C.R., Candeias, A.L.B., Fuzzy Kohonen clustering networks for interval data (2013) Neurocomputing, 99, pp. 65-75; Bazaraa, M.S., Sherali, H.D., Shetty, C.M., (1993) Nonlinear programming- theory and algorithm, , Wiley, New York; Benson, H.P., Fractional programming with convex quadratic forms and functions (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 173, pp. 351-369; Ben-Tal, A., Boyd, S., Nemirovski, A., Extending scope of robust optimization: comprehensive robust counterparts of uncertain problems (2006) Math Program, 107, pp. 63-89; Ben-Tal, A., Nemirovski, A., Robust solutions of linear programming problems contaminated with uncertain data (2000) Math Program, 88, pp. 411-424; Ben-Tal, A., Nemirovski, A., Selected topics in robust convex optimization (2008) Math Program, 112B, pp. 125-158; Cambini, R., Sodini, C., A unifying approach to solve some classes of rank-three multiplicative and fractional programs involving linear functions (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 207, pp. 25-29; Černý, M., Hladík, M., The complexity of computation and approximation of the t-ratio over one-dimensional interval data (2014) Comput Stat Data Anal, 80, pp. 26-43; Chang, C.T., On the posynomial fractional programming problem (2002) Eur J Oper Res, 143, pp. 42-52; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Programming with linear fractional functional (1962) Nav Res Logist Q, 9, pp. 181-186; Christodoulou, C., Bugmann, G., Coefficient of variation vs. mean interspike interval curves: what do they tell us about the brain?

Simulation results demonstrate that the new confidence intervals perform very well in terms of empirical coverage probability and average interval length.

These models extend (weighted) distance-based linear models first to the generalized linear model framework. Then, a nonparametric version of these models is proposed by means of local fitting. Distances between individuals are the only predictor information needed to fit these models. Therefore, they are applicable, among others, to mixed (qualitative and quantitative) explanatory variables or when the regressor is of functional type. An implementation is provided by the R package dbstats, which also implements other distance-based prediction methods.

It is, therefore, natural to ask for possible extensions of time series models to accommodate the wealth of information. In this article, we develop a new model for financial volatility estimation and forecasting by incorporating exogenous covariates in a semi-parametric log-GARCH model. With additional information, we gain an increased prediction power. We propose a quasi-maximum likelihood procedure via spline smoothing technique. Consistent estimators and asymptotic normality are obtained under mild regularity conditions. Simulation experiments provide strong evidence that corroborates the asymptotic theories. Additionally, an application to SPY index data demonstrates strong competitive advantage of our model comparing with GARCH(1,1) and log-GARCH(1,1) models. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Exogenous variable; Financial volatility; Log-GARCH; Quasi-likelihood estimation; Semi-parametric regression; Spline,,"Andersen, T.G., Bollerslev, T., Answering the skeptics: yes, standard volatility models do provide accurate forecasts (1998) Int Econ Rev, 39 (4), pp. 885-905; Baker, S.R., Bloom, N., Davis, S.J., Measuring Economic Policy Uncertainty.

To utilize the information from not only the functional trajectories but also the observed class labels, we propose a probability-enhanced method achieved by weighted support vector machine based on its Fisher consistency property to estimate the effective dimension reduction space. Since only a few measurements are available for some, even all, individuals, a cumulative slicing approach is suggested to borrow information across individuals. We provide justification for validity of the probability-based effective dimension reduction space, and a straightforward implementation that yields a low-dimensional projection space ready for applying standard classifiers. The empirical performance is illustrated through simulated and real examples, particularly in contrast to classification results based on the prominent functional principal component analysis. © 2016, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Classification;

If all the weights are positive, then we have a classical finite mixture. If some weights are negative, then we have a negative mixture. Negative mixtures appear in different applied probability models (order statistics, estimators, coherent systems, etc.). The conditions to obtain stochastic comparisons of classical (positive) mixtures are well known in the literature. However, for negative mixtures, there are only results for the usual stochastic order. In this paper, conditions for hazard rate and likelihood ratio comparisons of generalized mixtures are obtained. These theoretical results are applied in this paper to study distribution-free comparisons of coherent systems using their representations as generalized mixtures. They can also be applied to other probability models in which the generalized mixtures appear. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Coherent systems; Generalized mixtures; Hazard rate; Stochastic comparisons,,"Agrawal, A., Barlow, R.E., A survey of network reliability and domination theory (1984) Oper Res, 32, pp. 478-492; Baggs, G.E., Nagaraja, H.N., Reliability properties of order statistics from bivariate exponential distributions (1996) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 12, pp. 611-631; Balakrishnan, N., Cramer, E., Progressive censoring from heterogeneous distributions with applications to robustness (2008) Ann Inst Stat Math, 60, pp. 151-171; Balakrishnan, N., Cramer, E., (2014) The art of progressive censoring: applications to reliability and quality, , Birkhäuser, New York; Balakrishnan, N., Xie, Q., Exact inference for a simple step-stress model with type-I hybrid censored data from the exponential distribution (2007) J Stat Plan Inference, 137, pp. 3268-3290; Balakrishnan, N., Xie, Q., Exact inference for a simple step-stress model with type-II hybrid censored data from the exponential distribution (2007) J Stat Plan Inference, 137, pp. 2543-2563; Balakrishnan, N., Xie, Q., Kundu, D., Exact inference for a simple step-stress model from the exponential distribution under time constraint (2009) Ann Inst Stat Math, 61, pp. 251-274; Barlow, R.E., Proschan, F., (1975) Statistical theory of reliability and life testing, , holt, rinehart and winston, New York; Block, H.W., Li, Y., Savits, T.H., Initial and final behavior of failure rate functions for mixtures and systems (2003) J Appl Probab, 40, pp. 721-740; Borgonovo, E., The reliability importance of components and prime implicants in coherent and non-coherent systems including total-order interactions (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 204, pp. 485-495; David, H.A., Nagaraja, H.N., (2003) Order statistics, , Wiley, New York; Everitt, B.S., Hand, D.J., (1981) Finite mixture distributions, , Chapman and Hall, New York; Franco, M., Balakrishnan, N., Kundu, D., Vivo, J.M., Generalized mixtures of weibull components (2014) Test, 23, pp. 515-535; Glaser, R.E., Bathtub and related failure rate characterizations (1980) J Am Stat Assoc, 75, pp. 667-672; Kamps, U., Cramer, E., On distributions of generalized order statistics (2001) Statistics, 35, pp. 269-280; Kochar, S., Mukerjee, H., Samaniego, F.J., The “signature” of a coherent system and its application to comparison among systems (1999) Naval Res Logist, 46, pp. 507-523; Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N., Johnson, N.L., (2000) Continuous multivariate distributions.

Under a Bayesian nonparametric framework, Dirichlet process location–scale mixture of Gaussian kernels is the golden standard, both having nice theoretical properties and computational tractability. In this paper we explore the use of the skew-normal kernel, which can naturally accommodate several degrees of skewness by the use of a third parameter. The choice of this kernel function allows us to formulate nonparametric location–scale–shape mixture prior with desirable theoretical properties and good performance in different applications. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms are also discussed and the performance of the methods are tested through simulations and applications to galaxy velocity and fertility data. Extensions to accommodate discrete data are also discussed. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Discrete random probability measures; Model-based clustering; Rounded mixture priors; Skew-normal distribution,,"Arellano-Valle, R.B., Azzalini, A., On the unification of families of skew-normal distributions (2006) Scand J Stat, 33 (3), pp. 561-574; Arellano-Valle, R.B., Genton, M.G., Loschi, R.H., Shape mixture of multivariate skew-normal distributions (2009) J Multivar Anal, 100, pp. 91-101; Azzalini, A., A class of distributions which includes the normal ones (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Cabras, S., Racugno, W., Castellanos, M., Ventura, L., A matching prior for the shape parameter of the skew-normal distribution (2012) Scand J Stat, 39, pp. 236-247; Canale, A., Dunson, D.B., Bayesian kernel mixtures for counts (2011) J Am Stat Assoc, 106 (496), pp. 1528-1539; Canale, A., Scarpa, B., (2013) Informative bayesian inference for the skew-normal distribution. arXiv, 1305, p. 3080. , arXiv:1305.3080; Cavatti Vieira C, Loschi RH, Duarte D (2013) Nonparametric mixtures based on skew-normal distributions: an application to density estimation.

This is achieved via a model formulation that considers separately the central part and the tail of the distributions, using a two-component mixture model. Extremes beyond a threshold are assumed to follow a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). Temporal dependence is induced by allowing the GPD parameters to vary with time. Temporal variation and dependence is introduced at a latent level via the novel use of dynamic linear models (DLM). Novelty lies in the time variation of the shape and scale parameter of the resulting distribution. These changes in limiting regimes as time changes reflect better the data behavior, with important gains in estimation and interpretation. The central part follows a nonparametric mixture approach. The uncertainty about the threshold is explicitly considered. Posterior inference is performed through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. A variety of scenarios can be entertained and include the possibility of alternation of presence and absence of a finite upper limit of the distribution for different time periods. Simulations are carried out in order to analyze the performance of our proposed model. We also apply the proposed model to financial time series: returns of Petrobrás stocks and SP500 index. Results show advantage of our proposal over currently entertained models such as stochastic volatility, with improved estimation of high quantiles and extremes. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian; GPD; MCMC; Nonparametric,,"Behrens, C., Gamerman, D., Lopes, H.F., Bayesian analysis of extreme events with threshold estimation (2004) Stat Model, 4, pp. 227-244; Carvalho, C., Lopes, H.F., Simulation-based sequential analysis of markov switching stochastic volatility models (2007) Comput Stat Data An, 51 (9), pp. 4526-4542; Coles, S.G., (2001) Extreme value theory an applications, , Springer, London; Coles, S.G., Powell, E., Bayesian methods in extreme value modelling: a review and new developments (1996) Int Stat Rev, 64, pp. 119-136; Coles, S.G., Tawn, J.A., A bayesian analysis of extreme rainfall data (1996) Appl Stat, 45, pp. 463-478; Coles, S.G., Tawn, J.A., Modelling extremes of the areal rainfall process (1996) J Roy Stat Soc B Met, 58, pp. 329-347; Cooley, D., Cisewski, J., Erhardt, R.J., Jeon, S., Mannshardt, E., Omolo, B.O., Sun, Y., A survey of spatial extremes: measuring spatial dependence and modeling spatial effects (2012) REVSTAT, 10, pp. 135-165; Dey, D., Kuo, L., Sahu, S., A bayesian predictive approach to determining the number of components in a mixture distribution (1995) Stat Comput, 5, pp. 297-305; Dierckx, G., Teugels, J.L., Change point analysis of extreme values (2010) Environmetrics, 21, pp. 661-686; DuMouchel, M.H., Estimating the stable index α in order to measure tail thickness: a critique (1983) Ann Stat, 11, pp. 1019-1031; Eastoe, S.F., Tawn, J.A., Modelling non-stationary extremes with application to surface level ozone (2009) J Roy Stat Soc C App, 58, pp. 24-45; Embrechts, P., Küppelberg, C., Mikosch, T., (1997) Modelling extremal events for insurance and finance, , Springer, New York; Gaetan, C., Grigoletto, M., Smoothing sample extremes with dynamic models (2004) Extremes, 7, pp. 221-236; Gamerman, D., Lopes, H.F., (2006) Markov chain Monte Carlo: stochastic simulation for Bayesian inference, , Chapman and Hall/CRC, Baton Rouge; Huerta, G., Sansó, B., Time-varying models for extreme values (2007) Environ Ecol Stat, 14 (3), pp. 285-299; Jonathan, P., Ewans, K., A spatiodirectional model for extreme waves in the gulf of mexico (2011) J Offshore Mech Arct, 133, p. 9p; Lopes, H.F., Polson, N., Extracting sp500 and nasdaq volatility: The credit crisis of 2007–2008.

(Math Methods Stat 8(3):407–425, 1999), Chay and Powell (J Econ Perspect 15(4):29–42, 2001)]. In this paper, we consider censored high-dimensional data. High-dimensional models are in some way more complex than their low-dimensional versions, therefore some different techniques are required. For the linear case, appropriate estimators based on penalised regression have been developed in the last years [see for example Bickel et al. (Ann Stat 37(4):1705–1732, 2009), Koltchinskii (Bernoulli 15:799–828, 2009)]. In particular, in sparse contexts, the (Formula presented.) -penalised regression (also known as LASSO) [see Tibshirani (J R Stat Soc Ser B 58:267–288, 1996), Bühlmann and van de Geer (Statistics for high-dimensional data. Springer, Heidelberg, 2011) and reference therein] performs very well. Only few theoretical work was done to analyse censored linear models in a high-dimensional context.

The focus is on the linear model involving a fixed design matrix and additive errors restricted to the dependent variables consisting of noise and sparse outliers. We derive sharp error bounds for the estimator in terms of the leverage constants of a design matrix introduced here. A similar analysis is performed for Huber’s estimator using an equivalent problem formulation of independent interest. Our analysis considers outliers of arbitrary magnitude, and we recover breakdown point results as particular cases when outliers diverge.

Our censored measurement error regression model is specified by assuming heavy-tailed distributions for the underlying probabilistic process. Specifically, we focus on assuming a multivariate joint distribution for the error terms and the unobserved true covariates. For the model estimation, we consider the maximum likelihood methodology in which we include the estimation of the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimators. We also develop an EM algorithm to obtain the estimates. The performance of the newly developed methodology is evaluated throughout a simulation study as well as a case study analysis. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Censored regression; Expectation-maximization algorithm; Multivariate distribution; Scale mixtures of normal distributions,,"Amemiya, T., (1985) Advanced econometrics, , Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Arellano-Valle, R.B., Bolfarine, H., On some characterizations of the distribution (1995) Stat Probab Lett, 25, pp. 179-185; Arellano-Valle, R.A., Bolfarine, H., Elliptical structural models (1996) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 25, pp. 2319-2341; Arellano-Valle, R.B., Ozan, S., Bolfarine, H., Lachos, V.H., Skew normal measurement error models (2005) J Multivar Anal, 96, pp. 265-281; Arellano-Valle, R.B., Castro, L.M., González-Farias, G., Muñoz-Gajardo, K.A., Student-censored regression model: properties and inference (2012) Stat Methods Appl, 21, pp. 453-473; Azzalini, A., (2014) The skew-normal and related families, , Cambridge University Press (Monograph), New York; Bolfarine, H., Arellano-Valle, R.B., Weak nondifferential erros models (1998) Stat Probab Lett, 40, pp. 279-287; Cameron, A.C., Trivedi, P.K., (2010) Microeconometrics using stata, revised edn, , Stata Press, College Station; Dempster, A.P., Laird, N.M., Rubin, D.B., Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm (1977) J R Stat Soc Ser B (Methodological), 39 (1), pp. 1-38; Fang, K.T., Kotz, S., Ng, K.W., (1990) Symmetric multivariate and related distributions, , Chapman and Hall, London; Fuller, W.A., (1987) Measurement error models, , Wiley, New York; Gleser, L.J., The importance of assessing measurement reliability in multivariate regression (1992) J Am Stat Assoc, 87, pp. 696-707; Lin, T.I., Ho, H.J., Chen, C.L., Analysis of multivariate skew normal models with incomplete data (2009) J Multivar Anal, 100, pp. 2337-2351; Lin, T.I., Lin, T.C., Robust statistical modelling using the multivariate skew distribution with complete and incomplete data (2011) Stat Model, 11, pp. 253-277; Lucas, A., Robustness of the student-estimator (1997) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 26 (5), pp. 1165-1182; Maddala, G.S., (1983) Limited-dependent and qualitative variables in econometrics, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Marchenko, Y.V., Genton, M.G., A Heckman selection-t model (2012) J Am Stat Assoc, 107, pp. 304-317; Matos, L.A., Prates, M.O., Chen, M.H., Lachos, V.H., Likelihood-based inference for mixed-effects models with censored response using the multivariate distribution (2013) Stat Sinica, 23, pp. 1323-1342; Meng, X.L., Rubin, D.B., Maximum likelihood estimation via the ECM algorithm: a general framework (1993) Biometrika, 80, pp. 267-278; Polasek, W., Krause, A., Bayesian regression model with simple errors in variables structure (1993) J R Stat Soc Ser D (The Statistician), 42, pp. 571-580; Tobin, J., Estimation of relationships for limited dependent variables (1958) Econometrica, 26, pp. 24-36; Wang, L., Estimation of censored linear error-in-variables models (1998) J Econ, 84, pp. 383-400; Wang, L., A simple adjustement for measurement erros in some limited dependent variable (2002) Stat Probab Lett, 58, pp. 427-433",English,Article

However, empirical evidence has shown that the truncation variable may depend on the lifetime of interest in many real-world examples. The lack of independence can lead to seriously biased analysis. In this article, we revisit an existing estimation procedure for survival under a copula-based dependent truncation model. Here, the same estimating equation is adopted but a different algorithm to solve the equation is proposed. We compare the new algorithm with the existing one and discuss its theoretical and practical usefulness. Real data examples are analyzed for illustration.

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a model selection criterion widely used in practical applications. The AIC is an estimator of the expected log-likelihood value, and measures the discrepancy between the true model and the estimated model. In small samples, the AIC is biased and tends to select overparameterized models. To circumvent that problem, we propose two new selection criteria, namely: the bootstrapped likelihood quasi-CV and its 632QCV variant. We use Monte Carlo simulation to compare the finite sample performances of the two proposed criteria to those of the AIC and its variations that use the bootstrapped log-likelihood in the class of varying dispersion beta regressions. The numerical evidence shows that the proposed model selection criteria perform well in small samples.

In this context, the linear predictor of the beta regression model incorporates an unknown smooth function with time as an auxiliary covariate and a set of regressors. In addition, an autoregressive dependence structure is proposed for the errors of the model. This formulation can capture the dynamic evolution of curves using both non-stochastic explanatory variables and non-parametric components, allowing an accurate fit with a limited number of parameters. Diagnostic measures are derived from the case-deletion approach and an influence measure based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence is studied and thus, a new method to determine the optimal order of the autoregressive processes through an adaptive procedure using the conditional predictive ordinate statistic is presented. A simulation study is conducted to assess some properties of the Bayesian estimator. Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated in two real-life applications. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Autoregressive processes; Bayesian modeling; Beta regression; Partially linear model,,"Benjamin, M., Rigby, R., Stasinopoulos, M., Generalized autoregressive moving average models (2011) J Am Stat Assoc, 98, pp. 214-223; Bonat, W.H., Ribeiro, P.L., Jr., Zeviani, W.M., Likelihood analysis for a class of beta mixed models (2015) J Appl Stat, 42, pp. 252-266; Billio, M., Casarin, R., Beta autoregressive transition Markov-switching models for business cycle analysis (2011) Stud Nonlinear Dyn Econ, 15, pp. 1-30; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (1991) Time Series: Theory and Methods, , Springer, New York; Brooks, S., Gelman, A., General methods for monitoring convergence of iterative simulations (1998) J Comput Graph Stat, 7, pp. 434-455; Casarin, R., Dalla Valle, L., Leisen, F., Bayesian model selection for beta autoregressive processes (2012) Bayesian Anal, 7, pp. 385-410; Cepeda, E., Modelagem da variabilidade em modelos lineares generalizados.

A convex criterion function based on a usual criterion function and an appropriate cost function is considered. A specific L-optimal design problem and a numerical example are taken from Conlisk (J Econ 11:63–76, 1979) to compare the procedure. The problem would need integer nonlinear programming to obtain exact designs. To avoid this, he solves a continuous nonlinear programming problem and then he rounds off the number of replicates of each experiment. The procedure provided in this paper reduces dramatically the computational efforts in computing optimal approximate designs. It is based on a specific formulation of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the full-information maximum likelihood estimators, which simplifies the calculations. The design obtained for estimating the structural parameters of the numerical example by this procedure is not only easier to compute, but also more efficient than the design provided by Conlisk. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Approximate design; Cost constraints; Exact design; L-optimal design; Multiplicative algorithm; Simultaneous equations; Structural equations,,"Amo-Salas, M., López-Fidalgo, J., Porcu, E., Optimal designs for some stochastic processes whose covariance is a function of the mean (2013) Test, 22, pp. 159-181; Atwood, C.L., Convergent design sequences, for sufficiently regular optimality criteria (1976) Ann Stat, 4 (6), pp. 1124-1138; BAZI, Berechnung von Anzahlen mit Zuteilungsmethoden im Internet / Calculation of Allocations by Apportionment Methods in the InternetCasero-Alonso V, López-Fidalgo J (2014) Experimental designs in triangular simultaneous equations models.

An arriving batch, finding the server busy, enters an orbit. Otherwise, one customer, a few customers, or all customers from the arriving batch, depending on if the batch size exceeds a threshold value or not, enter service immediately, while the rest join the orbit. Customers from the orbit try to reach the server subsequently with the inter-retrial times, exponentially distributed. Additionally, at each service completion epoch, one of the two types of search mechanisms say, type I and type II search, to bring the orbital customers to service, is switched on—type I search when the orbit size is less than the threshold value and type II search otherwise. This means that, while the server is idle, a competition takes place among primary customers, customers who come by retrial and by one of the two types of search as the case may be. A type I search selects a single customer whereas a type II search takes a batch of customers from the orbit. In the case of primary customers and those who come by type II search, maximum size of the batch taken into service is restricted to a pre-assigned value. Both single and batch service are assumed to be arbitrarily distributed with different distributions, which are independent of each other. Steady state analysis is performed.

The spatial dependence structure modeling is an indispensable tool to estimate the parameters that define this structure. In this paper, we use the family of elliptical distributions to estimate the spatial dependence in referenced data. Thus we extend the Gaussian spatial linear model. Also we use the local influence methodology to assess the sensitivity of the maximum likelihood estimators to small perturbations in the data and/or in the spatial linear model assumptions. The methodology is illustrated with a real data set. The results allowed us to conclude that the presence of atypical values in the sample data have a strong influence, changing the spatial dependence structure. Also we have included a small simulation study. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Elliptical distributions; Geostatistics; Local influence; Maximum likelihood; Spatial variability,,"Atkinson, A.C., Riani, M., Cerioli, A., (2004) Exploring multivariate data with the forward search, , Springer, New York;

They may require less stringent moment assumptions, be less sensitive to outliers, be less rigid, employ more a priori information regarding the location of the distribution, and have higher potential for various regression generalizations than their common elliptical predecessor defined in the convex optimization framework by means of standard linear quantile regression. Furthermore, they still include an equivalent of their predecessor as a special case and inherit most of its favorable features such as the probability interpretation, natural equivariance properties, and good behavior for elliptical and symmetric distributions, which is demonstrated both by theoretical results and data examples with convincing graphical output. On the other hand, the new elliptical quantiles need not always be uniquely defined and they require somewhat different approach to their analysis and computation due to their intrinsically non-convex formulation. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Elliptical quantile; Multivariate quantile; Multivariate statistical inference; Portfolio optimization; Quantile regression,,"Bertsimas, D., Lauprete, G.J., Samarov, A., Shortfall as a risk measure: properties, optimization and applications (2004) J Econ Dyn Control, 28, pp. 1353-1381; Davies, P.L., Asymptotic behavior of S-estimates of multivariate location parameters and dispersion matrices (1987) Ann Stat, 15, pp. 1269-1292; Došlá, Š., Conditions for bimodality and multimodality of a mixture of two unimodal densities (2009) Kybernetika, 45, pp. 279-292; Hallin, M., Paindaveine, D., Šiman, M., Multivariate quantiles and multiple-output regression quantiles: from optimization to halfspace depth (2010) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 635-669; Hallin, M., Paindaveine, D., Šiman, M., Rejoinder (2010) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 694-703; Hallin M, Lu Z, Paindaveine D, Šiman M (2014) Local bilinear multiple-output quantile/depth regression.

Since such properties are defined for single-valued allocation rules, we use the core-center (González-Díaz and Sánchez-Rodríguez, Int J Game Theory 36:27–46, 2007) as a proxy for the core. This is natural, since the core-center is the center of gravity of the core and its behavior with respect to a given property can be interpreted as the “average behavior” of the core. We also introduce the lower-cost increasing monotonicity and higher-cost decreasing monotonicity properties that reflect whether a variation in a particular agent’s cost is beneficial to the other agents. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Airport games; Cooperative TU games; Core; Core-center; Monotonicity,,"Arin, J., Monotonic core solutions: beyond Young’s theorem (2013) Int J Game Theory, 42, pp. 325-337; Calleja, P., Rafels, C., Tijs, S., The aggregate-monotonic core (2009) Games Econ Behav, 66, pp. 742-748; Getán, J., Montes, J., Rafels, C., A note on the monotonic core (2009) Int Game Theory Rev, 11, pp. 229-235; Gillies, D.B., (1953) Some theorems on n-person games, , PhD thesis, Princeto; González-Díaz J, Mirás-Calvo, MA, Quinteiro-Sandomingo C, Sánchez-Rodríguez E(2014) On the core of an airport game and the properties of its center.

Assuming that the one-stage cost is possibly unbounded and that the distributions of $$\xi _{n}$$ξn are unknown, we study the corresponding optimal control problem under two settings. Firstly we assume that the random disturbance process $$\left\{ \xi _{n}\right\} $$ξn is formed by observable independent and identically distributed random variables, and then we introduce an estimation and control procedure to construct strategies. Instead, in the second one, $$\left\{ \xi _{n}\right\} $$ξn is assumed to be non-observable whose distributions may change from stage to stage, and in this case the problem is studied as a minimax control problem in which the controller has an opponent selecting the distribution of the corresponding random disturbance at each stage. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Discounted optimality; Estimation and control procedures; Minimax control systems; Non-constant discount factors,,"Altman, E., (1999) Constrained Markov decision processes, , Chapman and Hall, Londo; Ash, R.B., (1972) Real analysis and probability, , Academic Press, New Yor; Bertsekas, D.P., Shreve, S.E., (1978) Stochastic optimal control: the discrete-time case, , Academic Press, New Yor; Bertsekas, D.P., (1987) Dynamic programming: deterministic and stochastic models, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliff; Borkar, V.S., A convex analytic approach to Markov decision processes (1998) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 78, pp. 583-602; Brigo, D., Mercurio, F., (2007) Interest rate models: theory and practice, , Springer, New Yor; Carmon, Y., Shwartz, A., Markov decision processes with exponentially representable discounting (2009) Oper Res Lett, 37, pp. 51-55; Dynkin, E.B., Yushkevich, A.A., (1979) Controlled Markov processes, , Springer, New Yor; Feinberg, E.A., Shwartz, A., Markov decision models with weighted discounted criteria (1994) Math Oper Res, 19, pp. 152-168; Feinberg, E.A., Shwartz, A., Constrained Markov decision models with weighted discounted rewards (1995) Math Oper Res, 20, pp. 302-320; Feinberg, E.A., Shwartz, A., Constrained dynamic programming with two discount factors: applications and an algorithm (1999) IEEE Trans Autom Control, 44, pp. 628-631; González-Hernández, J., López-Martínez, R.R., Pérez-Hernández, R., Markov control processes with randomized discounted cost in Borel space (2007) Math Methods Oper Res, 65, pp. 27-44; González-Hernández, J., López-Martínez, R.R., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Adaptive policies for stochastic systems under a randomized discounted criterion (2008) Bol Soc Mat Mex, 14, pp. 149-163; González-Hernández, J., López-Martínez, R.R., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Approximation, estimation and control of stochastic systems under a randomized discounted cost criterion (2009) Kybernetika, 45, pp. 737-754; González-Hernández, J., López-Martínez, R.R., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Gabriel-Arguelles, J.R., Constrained Markov control processes with randomized discounted cost criteria: occupation measures and extremal points (2013) Risk Decis Anal, 4, pp. 163-176; González-Hernández, J., López-Martínez, R.R., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Gabriel-Arguelles, J.R., Constrained Markov control processes with randomized discounted rate: infinite linear programming approach (2014) Optim Control Appl Methods, 35, pp. 575-591; González-Trejo, T.J., Hernández-Lerma, O., Hoyos-Reyes, L.F., Minimax control of discrete-time stochastic systems (2003) SIAM J Control Optim, 41, pp. 1626-1659; Gordienko, E.I., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Adaptive control for discrete-time Markov processes with unbounded costs: discounted criterion (1998) Kybernetika, 34, pp. 217-234; Heath, D., Jarrow, R., Morton, A., Bond pricing and the term structure of interest rates: a new methodology (1992) Econometrica, 60, pp. 77-105; Hernández-Lerma, O., (1989) Adaptive Markov control processes, , Springer, New Yor; Hernández-Lerma, O., Lasserre, J.B., (1996) Discrete-time Markov control processes: basic optimality criteria, , Springer, New Yor; Hernández-Lerma, O., Lasserre, J.B., (1999) Further topics on discrete-time Markov control processes, , Springer, New Yor; Hernández-Lerma, O., González-Hernández, J., Constrained Markov control processes in Borel spaces: the discounted case (2000) Math Methods Oper Res, 52, pp. 271-285; Hilgert, N., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Adaptive policies for time-varying stochastic systems under discounted criterion (2001) Math Methods Oper Res, 54, pp. 491-505; Hilgert, N., Minjárez-Sosa, J.A., Adaptive control of stochastic systems with unknown disturbance distribution: discounted criteria (2006) Math Methods Oper Res, 63, pp. 443-460; Hinderer, K., Foundations of non-stationary dynamic programming with discrete time parameter (1979) Lecture Notes Oper.

The matroidal structure of the single covers is established and used in a new and simple validity proof of the dual greedy algorithm for static single cover problems. Moreover, a primal greedy algorithm is derived which uses a new procedure to find the collection of all minimal deficient sets. For static plural cover problems on trees two linear-time algorithms to solve simultaneous and non-simultaneous problems with uniform costs are presented; for the simultaneous scenario with non-uniform costs, a pseudo-polynomial algorithm is proposed which can be turned into a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme. In contrast to its static counterpart, the single cover problem in dynamic, i.e., time-varying networks is shown to be strongly NP-hard. For special cases of the network topology polynomial algorithms are presented. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",(Dual) greedy algorithm; (Minimal) deficient set; Dynamic flow; Fully polynomial-time approximation scheme; Linear algorithm; Matroid; NP-hardness; Plural cover problem; Pseudo-polynomial algorithm; Single cover problem; Source location problem; Tree network,,"Ahuja, R.K., Magnanti, T.L., Orlin, J.B., (1993) Network flows: theory, algorithms, and applications, , Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle Rive; Andreev, K., Garrod, C., Maggs, B., Meyerson, M., Jansen, K., Khanna, S., Rolim, J.D.P., Ron, D., Simultaneous source location (2004) APPROX/RANDOM 2004—approximation, randomization, and combinatorial optimization: algorithms and techniques, Proceedings of the 7th international workshop on approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems and the 8th international workshop on randomization and computation, Cambridge, USA, August 22–24, 2004, Lecture notes in computer science, 3122, pp. 13-26. , Springer, Berli; Arata, K., Iwata, S., Makino, K., Fujishige, S., Locating sources to meet flow demands in undirected networks (2002) J Algorithms, 42, pp. 54-68; Arata, K., Iwata, S., Makino, K., Fujishige, S., Halldórsson, M.M., Locating sources to meet flow demands in undirected networks (2000) SWAT 2000—algorithm theory: proceedings of the 7th scandinavian workshop on algorithm theory, Bergen, Norway, July 5–7, 2000, Lecture notes in computer science, 1851, pp. 300-313. , Springer, Berli; Bárász, M., Becker, J., Frank, A., An algorithm for source location in directed graphs (2005) Oper Res Lett, 33, pp. 221-230; Bartholdi, J.J., III, Orlin, J.B., Ratliff, H.D., Cyclic scheduling via integer programs with circular ones (1980) Oper Res, 28, pp. 1074-1085; Bernáth A (2004/2011) A note on the directed source location algorithm.

The paper presents Inner and Outer Parallelization versions of the S-SDP algorithm, referred to as Inner P-SDP and Outer P-SDP, respectively, so that the problem solving elapsed time and gap reduction is analyzed. The basic idea of Inner P-SDP consists of parallelizing the optimization of variations of the MIP subproblems attached to the sets of scenario clusters created by the modeler-defined stages to decompose the original problem. The Outer P-SDP performs simultaneous interconnected executions of the serial algorithm, so that a wider feasibility area is explored using iterative communication to redefine search directions. Strategies are presented to analyze the performance of parallel computation based on Message-Passing Interface threads to solve stage-related subproblems versus the serial version of SDP methodology. The results of using the parallelization are remarkable, as not only faster but also better solutions than the serial version are obtained. In particular, we report up to 10 times speedup for 12 threads on the Inner P-SDP algorithm. The new approach allows problems to be solved using less computing time than a state-of-the-art MIP solver. It can thus solve very large-scale problems that could not otherwise be achieved by plain use of the solver or by the S-SDP algorithm in acceptable elapsed time, if any. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Inner and outer parallelization; Message-passing interface; Multistage stochastic mixed 0–1 optimization; Parallel computing; Stochastic dynamic programming,,"Al-Khamisl, T., M’Hallah, R., A two-stage stochastic programming model for the parallel machine scheduling problem with machine capacity (2011) Comput Oper Res, 38, pp. 1747-1759; Aldasoro, U., Escudero, L.F., Merino, M., Pérez, G., An algorithmic framework for solving large-scale multistage stochastic mixed 0–1 problems with nonsymmetric scenario trees.

We propose the weighted local linear CQR (WLLCQR) estimators for unknown coefficient function when selection probabilities are known, estimated nonparametrically or parametrically. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate that the WLLCQR estimators with estimating weights are more efficient than the true weights. Moreover, a goodness-of-fit test based on the WLLCQR fittings is developed to test whether the coefficient functions are actually varying. The finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology is assessed by simulation studies. A real data set is conducted to illustrate our proposed method. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Composite quantile regression; Inverse probability weighting; Missing at random; Varying-coefficient model,,"Cai, Z., Fan, J., Yao, Q., Functional-coefficient regression models for nonlinear time series (2000) J Am Stat Assoc, 95, pp. 941-956; Chiang, C.T., Rice, J.A., Wu, C.O., Smoothing spline estimation for varying coefficient models with repeatedly measured dependent variables (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96, pp. 605-619; Eubank, R.L., Huang, C., Maldonado, Y.M., Wang, N., Wang, S., Buchanan, R.J., Smoothing spline estimation in varying coefficient models (2004) J R Stat B, 66, pp. 653-667; Fan, J., Zhang, J.T., Statistical estimation in varying coefficient models (1999) Ann Stat, 27, pp. 1491-1518; Fan, J., Zhang, C.M., Zhang, J., Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon (2001) Ann Statist, 29, pp. 153-193; Guo, X., Xu, W., Goodness-of-fit tests for general linear models with covariates missed at random (2012) J Stat Plan Inference, 142, pp. 2047-2058; Jie, G., Tian, M.Z., New efficient and robust estimation in varying-coefficient models with heteroscedasticity (2012) Stat Sin, 22, pp. 1075-1101; Hastie, T.J., Tibishirani, R.J., Varying-coefficient models (1993) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 55, pp. 757-796; Huang, J., Wu, C.O., Zhou, L., Varying coefficient models and basis function approximations for the analysis of repeated measurements (2002) Biometrika, 89, pp. 111-128; Jiang, R., Qian, W.M., Zhou, Z.G., Variable selection and coefficient estimation via composite quantile regression with randomly censored data (2012) Stat Probab Lett, 82, pp. 308-317; Kai, B., Li, R., Zou, H., New efficient estimation and variable selection methods for semiparametric varying-coefficient partially linear models (2011) Ann Stat, 39, pp. 305-332; Knight, K., Limiting distributions for L1 regression estimators under general conditions (1998) Ann Stat, 26, pp. 755-770; Liang, H., Generalized partially linear models with missing covariates (2008) J Multivar Anal, 99, pp. 880-895; Liang, H., Wang, S., Robins, J.M., Carroll, R.J., Estimation in partially linear models with missing covariates (2004) J Am Stat Assoc, 99, pp. 357-367; Little, R.J.A., Rubin, D.B., (2002) Statistical analysis with missing data, , Wiley, New York; Ning, Z.J., Tang, L.J., Estimation and test procedures for composite quantile regression with covariates missing at random (2014) Stat Probab Lett, 95, pp. 15-25; Parzen, E., On estimation of a probability density function and model (1962) Ann Math Stat, 33, pp. 1065-1076; Robins, J.M., Rotnitsky, A., Zhao, L.P., Estimation of regression coefficients when some regressors are not always observed (1994) J Am Stat Assoc, 89, pp. 846-866; Rubin, D.B., Inference and missing data (1976) Biomoetrika, 63, pp. 581-592; Ruppert, D., Sheather, S.J., Wand, M.P., An effective bandwidth selector for local least squares regression (1995) J Am Stat Assoc, 90, pp. 1257-1270; Sherwood, B., Wang, L., Zhou, A., Weighted quantile regression for analyzing health care cost data with missing covariates (2013) Stat Med, 32, pp. 4967-4979; Sun, J., Gai, Y., Lin, L., Weighted local linear composite quantile estimation for the case of general error distributions (2013) J Stat Plan Inference, 143, pp. 1049-1063; Tsiatis, A.A., (2006) Semiparametric theory and missing data, , Springer, New York; Wong, H., Guo, S.J., Chen, M., On locally weighted estimation and hypothesis testing on varying coefficient models (2009) J Stat Plan Inference, 139, pp. 2933-2951; Wu, C.O., Yu, K.F., Chiang, C.T., A two-step smoothing method for varying coefficient models with repeated measurements (2000) Ann Inst Stat Math, 52, pp. 519-543; Yang, Y.P., Xue, L.G., Cheng, W.H., Empirical likelihood for a partially linear model with covariate data missing at random (2009) J Stat Plan Inference, 139, pp. 4143-4153; Yang, H., Lv, J., (2014) Guo CH, , Weighted composite quantile regression estimation and variable selection for varying coefficient models with heteroscedasticity, J Korean Stat Soc (Online; Zhang, W., Lee, S., Song, X., Local polynomial fitting in semivarying coefficient models (2000) J Multivar Anal, 82, pp. 166-188; Zou, H., Yuan, M., Composite quantile regression and the oracle model selection theory (2008) Ann Stat, 36, pp. 1108-1126",English,Article

The variance estimator is uniformly oracally efficient, that is, it is as efficient as, up to order less than $$n^{-1/2}$$n-1/2, the infeasible kernel estimator when the conditional mean function is known, uniformly over the data range. Simulation experiments provide strong evidence that confirms the asymptotic theory while the computing is extremely fast.

This concept is relatively recent, so there are still many unknown aspects that require further research. In this work, for δ≥0, we investigate the distribution theory of δ-record values from an iid sample from an absolutely continuous parent. We obtain recurrent expressions for the density function of δ-records and the probability mass function of inter-δ-record times. In the particular case of the exponential distribution, we show that the sequence of δ-records are distributed as the points of a (delayed) renewal process. Finally, we point out some applications of δ-records to paralyzable counters, blocks in automobile traffic, and queuing theory. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Counting processes; Distribution theory; Exponential distributions; Records; Type II particle counters,,"Ahsanullah, M., (2004) Record values: theory and applications, , University Press of America, Lanham; Albert, G.E., Nelson, L., Contributions to the statistical theory of counter data (1953) Ann Math Stat, 24, pp. 9-22; Arnold, B.C., Balakrishnan, N., Nagaraja, H.N., Records (1998) Wiley Series in probability and statistics: probability and statistics, , Wiley: New York, a Wiley-Interscience Publication; Balakrishnan, N., Pakes, A.G., Stepanov, A., On the number and sum of near-record observations (2005) Adv Appl Probab, 37 (3), pp. 765-780; Chandler, K.N., The distribution and frequency of record values (1952) J Roy Stat Soc Ser B, 14, pp. 220-228; Eliazar, I., On geometric record times (2005) Phys A, 348 (1-4), pp. 181-198; Embrechts, P., Klüppelberg, C., Mikosch, T., (1997) Modelling extremal events, applications of mathematics (New York), , 33, Springer, Berlin; Feller, W., On probability problems in the theory of counters (1948) Studies and essays presented to R.

While most of the usual tools are based on the cumulative distribution functions $$F$$F and $$F_0$$F0 of the variables, we focus on the relative density, a function recently used in two-sample problems, and defined as the density of the variable $$F_0(X)$$F0(X). We provide a nonparametric adaptive strategy to estimate the target function. We first define a collection of estimates using a projection on the trigonometric basis and a preliminary estimator of $$F_0$$F0. An estimator is selected among this collection of projection estimates, with a criterion in the spirit of the Goldenshluger–Lepski methodology. We show the optimality of the procedure both in the oracle and the minimax sense: the convergence rate for the risk computed from an oracle inequality matches with the lower bound that we also derived. Finally, some simulations illustrate the method. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Model selection; Nonparametric estimation; Relative density; Two-sample problem,,"Barron, A., Birgé, L., Massart, P., Risk bounds for model selection via penalization (1999) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 113 (3), pp. 301-413;

The objectives of this paper are twofold. First, we want to correct and improve the recently studied model by optimizing the review period, back-order price discount, target level and lead time simultaneously to achieve significant savings in the total related cost and higher service level. Second, we consider that the demands of the different customers are not identical in the protection interval to accommodate more practical features of the real inventory systems. For the proposed model, a computational algorithm with the help of the software Mathematica 7 is furnished to derive the optimal solution. Finally, we provide numerical examples to illustrate the results. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Crashing cost; Discount; Inventory; Mixtures of distributions; Periodic review,,"Bartoszewicz, A., Lesniewski, P., Reaching law approach to the sliding mode control of periodic review inventory systems (2014) IEEE Trans Autom Sci Eng, 11 (3), pp. 810-817; Ben-Daya, M., Raouf, A., Inventory models involving lead time as decision variable (1994) J Oper Res Soc, 45, pp. 579-582; Chen, C.K., Chang, H.C., Ouyang, L.Y., A continuous review inventory model with ordering cost dependent on lead time (2001) Inf Manag Sci, 12 (3), 13p; Chiu, P.P., Economic production quantity models inventory involving lead time as a decision variable.

We consider this problem when the data may contain independent cellwise and casewise outliers. Flat data sets with a large number of variables and a relatively small number of cases are common place in modern statistical applications. In these cases, global down-weighting of an entire case, as performed by traditional robust procedures, may lead to poor results.

We estimate this important characteristic of the underlying process by solving numerically the estimated Fredholm equation.

In fact, two examples illustrate that standard techniques for the construction of upper bounds may fail in this setting. Instead, we propose to perturb infeasible iterates along Mangasarian–Fromovitz directions to feasible points whose objective function values serve as upper bounds. These directions may be calculated by the solution of a single linear optimization problem per iteration. Preliminary numerical results indicate that our enhanced algorithm solves optimization problems where a standard branch-and-bound method does not converge to the correct optimal value. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Branch-and-bound; Consistency; Convergence; Mangasarian–Fromovitz constraint qualification,,"Adjiman, C.S., Dallwig, S., Floudas, C.A., Neumaier, A., A global optimization method, (Formula presented.), for general twice-differentiable constrained NLPs-I.

We apply different classification techniques to two real-life medical data sets related to a group of patients reporting the typical symptoms of this syndrome. We are particularly interested in the performance of “Box-Clustering” (BC), a method that is able to favor readability and interpretation of the results by medical doctors, thanks to its “box-type” output which naturally configures as a medical report. Preliminary results of a basic implementation of BC applied to different data sets already exist in the literature, and here we add more. In particular, in this paper, we apply a recently developed (and specialized) implementation of BC, and we test it for the first time on real-life medical data related to the CTS. Our purpose is to evaluate the performance of BC for automatic diagnosis, as well as, gain in explanation capability and interpretability.

CB-CTT has been proposed for one track of the Second International Timetabling Competition (ITC-2007). Since then, several solution methods have been proposed and their results could have been tracked thanks to the web platform hosted at http://satt.diegm.uniud.it/ctt. In the following lines, some thoughts and remarks will be given, mainly from the SAT-solving point of view. First, we review some facts about CB-CTT and remark some characteristics that, to our understanding, may have helped the community to do better research. Later, from the different cited approaches, we observe two things: (1) how the problem has been represented (the modeling language) and (2) the solving algorithms. Finally, we close this comment pointing out some possible future work in CB-CTT. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",,,"Abío, I., Nieuwenhuis, R., Oliveras, A., Rodríguez-Carbonell E (2013) A parametric approach for smaller and better encodings of cardinality constraints Principles and practice of constraint programming, pp. 80-96. , Springer, Berlin; Ansótegui, C., Bonet, M.L., Levy, J., Solving (weighted) partial MaxSAT through satisfiability testing (2009) Theory and applications of satisfiability testing-SAT, 2009, pp. 427-440. , Springer, Berlin; In: Proceedings of SAT competition 2014: solver and benchmark descriptions, vol B-2014-2 (2014) p 39; Biere, A., Heule, M., van Maaren, H., Walsh, T., Handbook of satisfiability (2009) vol 185, , IOS Press, Amsterdam; Haken, A., The intractability of resolution (1985) Theor Comput Sci, 39, pp. 297-308; Nieuwenhuis, R., (2014) The intsat method for integer linear programming.

CB-CTT consists of finding the best weekly assignment of university course lectures to rooms and time periods. A feasible schedule must satisfy a set of hard constraints and must also take into account a set of soft constraints, whose violation produces penalty terms to be minimized in the objective function. From ITC-2007, many researchers have developed advanced models and methods to solve CB-CTT. This survey is devoted to review the main works on the topic, with focus on mathematical models, lower bounds, and exact and heuristic algorithms. Besides giving an overview of these approaches, we highlight interesting extensions that could make the study of CB-CTT even more challenging and closer to reality. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Curriculum-based course timetabling; Exact algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Models; Survey; University timetabling,,"Abdullah, S., Turabieh, H., On the use of multi neighbourhood structures within a tabu-based memetic approach to university timetabling problems (2012) Inf Sci, 191, pp. 146-168; Abdullah, S., Burke, E.K., McCollum, B., Using a randomised iterative improvement algorithm with composite neighbourhood structures for the university course timetabling problem (2007) Metaheuristics, operations research/computer science interfaces series, pp. 153-169. , Doerner K, Gendreau M, Greistorfer P, Gutjahr W, Hartl R, Reimann M, (eds), 39, Springer, US; Al-Yakoob, S., Sherali, H., A mixed-integer programming approach to a class timetabling problem: a case study with gender policies and traffic considerations (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 180 (3), pp. 1028-1044; Asín Achá, R., Nieuwenhuis, R., Curriculum-based course timetabling with SAT and MaxSAT (2014) Ann Oper Res, 218 (1), pp. 71-91; Atsuta, M., Nonobe, K., Ibaraki, T., Itc 2007 track 2, an approach using general csp solver (2008) Technical report; Avella, P., Vasiĺev, I., A computational study of a cutting plane algorithm for university course timetabling (2005) J Sched, 8 (6), pp. 497-514; Babaei, H., Karimpour, J., Hadidi, A., A survey of approaches for university course timetabling problem.

This paper provides an effective tool based on the simulated annealing philosophy. The performance of the proposed heuristic is guaranteed by a binary linear programming model (BP model). By relaxing some integrality conditions in the BP model, we can achieve optimal schedules in real instances gathered from several dubbed films. Yet, in most cases, it is not possible to obtain these optimal schedules in a suitable computational time.

An answer to this issue is provided using game theory and, specifically, the fact that an extension (i.e. a total preorder on the set of all subsets of objects) must be aligned with some probabilistic value, in the sense that the ranking of the objects (according to some probabilistic value computed on a numerical representation of the extension) must also preserve the primitive preorder on the singletons, no matter which utility function is used to represent the extension. We characterize families of aligned extensions, we focus on their geometric properties and we provide algorithms to verify their alignments. We also show that the framework introduced in this paper may be used to study a new class of extension problems, which integrate some features dealing with risk and complete uncertainty within the class of preference extension problems known in the literature with the name of sets as final outcomes. © 2015, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Coalitional games; Preference extensions; Semivalues,,"Banzhaf, J., III, Weighted voting doesn’t work: a mathematical analysis (1964) Rutgers Law Rev, 19, p. 317; Barberà, S., Barrett, C., Pattanaik, P., On some axioms for ranking sets of alternatives (1984) J Econ Theory, 33 (2), pp. 301-308; Barberà, S., Bossert, W., Pattanaik, P., Ranking sets of objects (2004) Handbook of Utility Theory: Extensions, 2, pp. 893-977; Bossert, W., Preference extension rules for ranking sets of alternatives with a fixed cardinality (1995) Theory Decis, 39 (3), pp. 301-317; Bossert, W., Pattanaik, P.K., Xu, Y., Ranking opportunity sets: an axiomatic approach (1994) J Econ Theory, 63 (2), pp. 326-345; Carreras, F., Freixas, J., de Swart, H., Some theoretical reasons for using (regular) semivalues (1999) Logic, game theory and social choice.

This subfamily can be seen as an extension of the Rayleigh distribution with more flexibility in terms of the kurtosis of distribution. This special feature makes the extension suitable for fitting atypical observations. It arises as the ratio of two independent random variables, the one in the numerator being a Rayleigh distribution and a power of the uniform distribution in the denominator. We study some probability properties, discuss maximum likelihood estimation and present real data applications indicating that the slashed-Rayleigh distribution can improve the ordinary Rayleigh distribution in fitting real data. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística All rights received.",Kurtosis; Rayleigh distribution; Slashed-elliptical distributions; Slashed-Rayleigh distribution; Slashed-Weibull distribution; Weibull distribution,,"Arslan, O., An alternative multivariate skew-slash distribution (2008) Statistics and Probability Letters, 78 (16), pp. 2756-2761; Aubin, S.L., The lognormal distribution for modeling quality data when the mean is near zero (1990) Journal of Quality Technology, 22, pp. 105-110; Balakrishnan, N., Kocherlakota, S., On the double Weibull distribution: Order statistics and estimation (1985) Sankhya, 47, pp. 161-178; Cordeiro, G.M., Cristino, C.T., Hashimoto, E.M., Ortega, E.M., The Beta generalized Rayleigh distribution with applications to lifetime data (2013) Statistical Papers, 54 (1), pp. 133-161; Devore, J., Probabilidad y Estadística para Ingeniería y Ciencias, 6 edn (2005) Editorial Thomson; Fang, K.T., Kotz, S., Ng, K.W., (1990) Symmetric Multivariate and Related Distributions, , Chapman and Hall, New York; Gómez, H.W., Olivares-Pacheco, J.F., Bolfarine, H., An extension of the generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution (2009) Statistics Probability Letters, 79 (3), pp. 331-338; Gómez, H.W., Quintana, F.A., Torres, F.J., A new family of slash-distributions with elliptical contours (2007) Statistics and Probability Letters, 77 (7), pp. 717-725; Gómez, H.W., Venegas, O., Erratum to: A new family of slashdistributions with elliptical contours [statist.

We obtain the estimators of the model parameters by using the maximum likelihood (ML) and the modified maximum likelihood (MML) methodologies (see, Tiku 1967). In the ML method, iteratively reweighting algorithm (IRA) is used to solve the likelihood equations. The MML approach is a non-iterative method used to obtain the explicit estimators of model parameters. We also propose new test statistics based on these estimators for testing the equality of treatment effects. Simulation results show that the proposed estimators and the tests based on them are more efficient and robust than the corresponding normal theory solutions. Also, real data is analysed to show the performance of the proposed estimators and the tests. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística.

The cointegration vector is homogeneous across individuals but we allow for individual heterogeneity using different short-run dynamics, individual-specific fixed effects and individual-specific time trends. We also model cross-sectional dependence using time-specific effects. The estimator has a Gaussian sequential limit distribution that is obtained by first letting T → ∞ and then letting N → ∞, M → ∞.

This distribution can be seen as an extension of the exponentiated Rayleigh distribution. This extension builds on the quotient of two independent random variables, one exponentiated Rayleigh in the numerator and Beta(q; 1) in the denominator with q > 0. It is called the slashed exponentiated Rayleigh random variable. There is evidence that the distribution of this new variable can be more flexible in terms of modeling the kurtosis regarding the exponentiated Rayleigh distribution. The properties of this distribution are studied and the parameter estimates are calculated using the maximum likelihood method. An application with real data reveals good performance of this new distribution. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística.

The system is regarded as operating only if at least s out of k (1 ≤ s ≤ k) strength variables exceeds the random stress. We estimate the reliability of the system by using frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The Bayes estimate of the reliability has been developed by using Lindley’s approximation and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods due to the lack of explicit forms. The asymptotic confidence interval and the highest probability density credible interval are constructed for the reliability.

Given the covariates, the conditional mean function is modeled as a partial linear model, and the conditional distribution function of model error is modeled as a single-index model. To estimate the single-index parameter, we propose a semi-parametric global weighted least-squares estimator coupled with an indicator function of the residuals. We derive a residual-based kernel estimator to estimate the unknown conditional distribution function. Asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators are derived, and the residual-based kernel process constructed by the estimator of the conditional distribution function is shown to converge to a Gaussian process. Simulation studies are conducted and a real dataset is analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Conditional distribution function; Empirical process; Kernel smoothing; Partial linear models; Single-index,,"Akritas, M.G., Van Keilegom, I., Non-parametric estimation of the residual distribution (2001) Scand J Stat, 28 (3), pp. 549-567; Carroll, R., Fan, J., Gijbels, I., Wand, M.P., Generalized partially linear single-index models (1997) J Am Stat Assoc, 92, pp. 477-489; Chen, H., Convergence rates for parametric components in a partly linear model (1988) Ann Stat, 16, pp. 136-146; Cui, X., Härdle, W.K., Zhu, L., The EFM approach for single-index models (2011) Ann Stat, 39 (3), pp. 1658-1688; Efang, K., Xia, Y., A single-index quantile regression model and its estimation (2012) Econ Theory, 28, pp. 730-768; Einmahl, J.H.J., Van Keilegom, I., Tests for independence in nonparametric regression (2008) Stat Sin, 18 (2), pp. 601-615; Fan, J., Zhang, W., Statistical estimation in varying coefficient models (1999) Ann Stat, 27, pp. 1491-1518; Härdle, W., Liang, H., Gao, J.T., (2000) Partially linear models, , Springer Physica, Heidelberg:; Härdle, W., Müller, M., Sperlich, S., Werwatz, A., (2004) Nonparametric and semiparametric models, , Springer-Verlag, New York:; Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Varying-coefficient models (1993) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 55, pp. 757-796; Heckman, N.E., Spline smoothing in partly linear models (1986) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 48, pp. 244-248; Kiwitt, S., Neumeyer, N., Estimating the conditional error distribution in non-parametric regression (2012) Scand J Stat, 39 (2), pp. 259-281; Kiwitt, S., Neumeyer, N., A note on testing independence by a copula-based order selection approach (2013) TEST, 22 (1), pp. 62-82; Li, K.C., Sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction (1991) J Am Stat Assoc, 86 (414), pp. 316-342; Liang, H., Li, R., Variable selection for partially linear models with measurement errors (2009) J Am Stat Assoc, 104, pp. 234-248; Liang, H., Wang, N., Partially linear single-index measurement error models (2005) Stat Sin, 15 (1), pp. 99-116; Liang, H., Härdle, W., Carroll, R.J., Estimation in a semiparametric partially linear errors-in-variables model (1999) Ann Stat, 27 (5), pp. 1519-1535; Liang, H., Liu, X., Li, R., Tsai, C.L., Estimation and testing for partially linear single-index models (2010) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 3811-3836; Liang, H., Wang, H., Tsai, C.L., Profiled forward regression for ultrahigh dimensional variable screening in semiparametric partially linear models (2012) Stat Sin, 22 (2), pp. 531-554; Müller, U.U., Schick, A., Wefelmeyer, W., Estimating the error distribution function in semiparametric regression (2007) Stat Decis, 25 (1), pp. 1-18; Neumeyer, N., Testing independence in nonparametric regression (2009) J Multivar Anal, 100 (7), pp. 1551-1566; Neumeyer, N., Van Keilegom, I., Estimating the error distribution in nonparametric multiple regression with applications to model testing (2010) J Multivar Anal, 101 (5), pp. 1067-1078; Owen, A., Empirical likelihood for linear models (1991) Ann Stat, 19, pp. 1725-1747; Qin, J., Lawless, J., Empirical likelihood and general estimating equations (1994) Ann Stat, 22, pp. 300-325; Quinlan, J.R., Combining instance-based and model-based learning.

Biased and imprecise estimation of parameters can lead to erroneous results. Our focus is to estimate the parameter of Power function distribution accurately because this density is now widely used for modelling various types of data. In this study, L-moments, TL-moments, LL-moments and LH-moments of Power function distribution are derived. In addition, the coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are obtained by method of moments, L-moments and TL-moments. Parameters of the density are estimated using linear moments and compared with method of moments and MLE on the basis of bias, root mean square error and coefficients through simulation study.

Often this uncertainty is ignored and the model with the best goodness-of-fit is assumed as the data generating model, leading to over-confident inferences. In this paper we present a methodology to account for model selection uncertainty in the estimation of age-dependent prevalence and force of infection, using model averaging of fractional polynomials. We illustrate the method on a seroprevalence crosssectional sample of hepatitis A, taken in 1993 in Belgium. In a simulation study we show that model averaged prevalence and force of infection using fractional polynomials have desirable features such as smaller mean squared error and more robust estimates as compared with the general practice of estimation based only on one selected “best” model. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística.",Bias; Mean squared error; Multimodel estimation; Seroprevalence,,"Agresti, A., (2002) Categorical Data Analysis, , 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York; Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical identification model (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19, pp. 716-723; Beutels, M., Damme, P.V., Aelvoet, W., Prevalence of hepatitis A, B and C in the flemish population (1997) European Journal of Epidemiology, 13, pp. 275-280; Buckland, S., Burnham, K., Augustin, N., Model selection: An integral part of inference (1997) Biometrics, 53, pp. 603-618; Burnham, K., Anderson, D., Model selection and multi model inference (2002) A Practical Information-Theoretic Approach, p. 2. , Springer, New York; Castañeda, J., Gerritse, B., Appraisal of several methods to model time to multiple events per subject: Modelling time to hospitalizations and death (2010) Revista Colombiana De Estadística, 11, pp. 43-61; Faes, C., Aerts, M., Geys, H., Molenberghs, G., Model averaging using fractional polynomials to estimate a safe level of exposure (2007) Risk Analysis, 27 (1), pp. 111-123; Farrington, C., Modeling forces of infection for measles, mumps and rubella (1990) Statistics in Medicine, 9, pp. 953-967; Goeyvaerts, N., Hens, N., Ogunjimi, B., Aerts, M., Shkedy, Z., Damme, P.V., Beutels, P., Estimating infectious disease parameters from data on social contacts and serological status (2010) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

In this paper we present compact flow-based models for the PMCARP, where two types of services are tackled, mandatory and optional. Adaptations of the models to fit into some other related problems are also proposed. The models are evaluated, according to their bounds quality as well as to the CPU times, over large sets of test instances.

The method is called global polynomial adjustment (GPA). It is a global correction which is applicable to any kernel hazard estimator. The estimator works well from a theoretical point of view as it asymptotically reduces bias with unchanged variance. A simulation study investigates the finite-sample properties of GPA. The method is tested on local constant and local linear estimators. From the simulation experiment we conclude that the global estimator improves the goodness-of-fit. An especially encouraging result is that the bias-correction works well for small samples, where traditional bias reduction methods have a tendency to fail. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística.

By making use of the Moreau envelopes of the functions occurring in the objective, we smooth them to convex and differentiable functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients using both variable and constant smoothing parameters. The resulting problem is solved via an accelerated first-order method and this allows us to recover approximately the optimal solutions to the initial optimization problem with a rate of convergence of order (Formula presented.) for variable smoothing and of order (Formula presented.) for constant smoothing. Some numerical experiments employing the variable smoothing method in image processing and in supervised learning classification are also presented. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Fast gradient method; Moreau envelope; Regularization; Variable smoothing,,"Bauschke, H.H., Combettes, P.L., Convex analysis and monotone operator theory in Hilbert spaces (2011) In: CMS books in mathematics., , Springer, New York; Beck, A., Teboulle, M., A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems (2009) SIAM J Imaging Sci, 2 (1), pp. 183-202; Beck, A., Teboulle, M., Smoothing and first order methods: a unified framework (2012) SIAM J Optim, 22 (2), pp. 557-580; Bertsekas, D., (1996) Constrained optimization and Lagrange Multiplier Methods, , Athena Scientific, Belmont; Borwein, J.M., Vanderwerff, J.D., (2010) Convex functions: constructions.

The main purpose is to obtain measures that serve as input for the reconstruction, in vector format, of a process of curves which are of interest, so that the extracted curves can be easily stored and reconstructed based on few parameters conserving representative information of its curvature at each pixel. As starting point, the directional information obtained from a methodology of consistent curves detection is used, which includes the decomposition of the image in a directional domain contained in R2k, with k 2 N. Basic summary measures criteria are proposed for this type of data and the application to four cases of satellite images for extraction of sections of rivers in these images are shown. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística.

Such inferences are beyond the confines of the standard (asymptotic) theory because a zero variance is on the boundary of the parameter space and the maximum likelihood or another reasonable estimator of variance has a non-trivial probability of zero in many settings. We derive decision rules regarding the variance ratio in balanced one-way analysis of variance, in both the frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. We argue that this approach is superior to hypothesis testing because it incorporates the consequences of the two kinds of error (incorrect choice) that may be committed.

The traditional approach to this problem is investigating the number of cointegration relations among the data by determining the trace and the maximum eigenvalue and obtaining the number of stationary long-run relations. Alternatively, this problem can be analyzed using dynamic factor models, which involves estimating the number of common factors, both stationary and not, that describe the behaviour of the data. In this context, we empirically analyze the power of such alternative approaches by applying them to time series that are simulated using known factorial models and to financial market data. The results show that when there are stationary common factors, when the number of observations is reduced and/or when the variables are part of more than one cointegration relation, the common factors test is more powerful than the usually applied cointegration tests. These results, together with the greater flexibility to identify the loading matrix of the data generating process, render dynamic factor models more suitable for use in multivariate time series analysis. © 015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística Allrights received.",Cointegration;

Furthermore, the variability in the measurement error and the latent process error may not fit conveniently into the Gaussian linear paradigm. In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting a predictor from a finite collection of spatial predictors of a spatial random process defined on D, a subset of d-dimensional Euclidean space. Critically, we make no statistical distributional assumptions other than additive measurement error. In this nonparametric setting, one could use a criterion based on a validation dataset to select a spatial predictor for all of D. Instead, we propose local criteria based on validation data to select a predictor at each spatial location in D; the result is a hybrid combination of the spatial predictors, which we call a locally selected predictor (LSP). We consider selection from a collection of some of the classical and more recently proposed spatial predictors currently available. In a simulation study, the relative performances of various LSPs, as well as the performance of each of the individual spatial predictors in the collection, are assessed. “Big Data” are always challenging, and here we apply LSP to a very large global spatial dataset of atmospheric CO2 measurements. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Best linear unbiased predictor; Information criteria; Model averaging; Model combination,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans Autom Control, 19, pp. 716-723; Amari, S., Murata, N., Finke, N.M.K.R., Yang, H.H., Asymptotic statistical theory of overtraining and cross-validation (1997) IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 8, pp. 985-996; Banerjee, S., Carlin, B.P., Gelfand, A.E., (2004) Hierarchical modeling and analysis for spatial data, , Chapman and Hall, London:; Banerjee, S., Gelfand, A.E., Finley, A.O., Sang, H., Gaussian predictive process models for large spatial data sets (2008) J Royal Stat Soc Ser B, 70, pp. 825-848; Bradley, J.R., Cressie, N., Shi T (2011) Selection of rank and basis functions in the spatial random effects model Proceedings of the 2011 joint statistical meetings, pp. 3393-3406. , American Statistical Association, Alexandria:; Bradley, J.R., Cressie, N., Shi T (2012) Local spatial-predictor selection Proceedings of the 2012 joint statistical meetings, pp. 3098-3110. , American Statistical Association, Alexandria:; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (1998) Model selection and multimodel inference, , Springer, New York:; Chahine, M., Pagano, T., Aumann, H., Atlas, R., Barnet, C., Blaisdell, J., Chen, L., Zhou, L., AIRS: improving weather forecasting and providing new data on greenhouse gases (2006) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 87, pp. 911-926; Chen, C.S., Huang, H.C., Geostatistical model averaging based on conditional information criteria (2011) Environ Ecol Stat, 19, pp. 23-35; Chen, C.-S., Huang, H.-C., An improved Cp criterion for spline smoothing (2011) J Stat Plan Inference, 141, pp. 445-452; Chen, Y.-P., Huang, H.-C., Tu, I.-P., A new approach for selecting the number of factors (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 2990-2998; Cressie, N., The origins of kriging (1990) Math Geol, 22, pp. 239-252; Cressie, N., (1993) Statistics for spatial data, , Wiley, New York:; Cressie, N., Johannesson G (2006) Spatial prediction for massive data sets Proceedings of Australian academy of science Elizabeth and Frederick White conference, pp. 1-11. , Australian Academy of Science: Canberra; Cressie, N., Johannesson, G., Fixed rank kriging for very large spatial data sets (2008) J Royal Stat Soc Ser B, 70, pp. 209-226; Cressie, N., Shi, T., Kang, E.L., Using temporal variability to improve spatial mapping with application to satellite data (2010) Can J Stat, 38, pp. 271-289; Cressie, N., Wikle, C.K., (2011) Statistics for spatio-temporal data, , Wiley, Hoboken:; Donoho, D., Johnstone, I., Ideal spatial adaptation by wavelet shrinkage (1994) Biometrika, 81, pp. 425-455; Efron, B., Estimating the error rate of a prediction rule: improvement on cross-validation (1983) J Am Stat Assoc, 78, pp. 316-331; Efron, B., How biased is the apparent error rate of a prediction rule?

Shah N.H.,Retailer’s replenishment and credit policies for deteriorating inventory under credit period-dependent demand and bad-debt loss,2015,TOP,298,312,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939891760&partnerID=40&md5=5f022fb71041f31563abe10af3219570,"The business world survives on trade credit financing. The three players, viz. supplier, retailer, and customer, are building blocks of any business firm. The retailer receives credit period from the supplier to settle the accounts due against the purchases. For retailer, the customer is a prominent stakeholder. To withstand the competitive market and generate credit sales and cash sales, the retailer offers credit period to attract more customers. This will boost the demand for the retailer and consequently the supplier. The offer of credit period by the result may result in bad-debt loss when the customer declares incapability to do the payment. The situation worsens when the items in the inventory system are subject to deterioration. In this article, a mathematical model is formulated to determine the optimal replenishment time and credit period under two levels of trade credit financing when the demand and bad-debt loss depend on the length of the credit period. The profit per unit time of the retailer is maximized by optimizing the cycle time and date-terms credit period when items in the inventory deteriorate at a constant rate. A numerical example is given to validate the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis is carried out and observations are deduced. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Credit-linked bad-debt loss; Credit-linked demand; Deterioration; Inventory; Two-level trade credit,,"Aggarwal, K.K., Tyagi, A.K., A model to jointly determine inventory and credit policies in an inventory system with date-terms credit linked demand (2013) Int J Model Oper Manag, 3 (1), pp. 53-69; Annadurai, K., Uthayakumar, R., Two-echelon inventory model for deteriorating items with credit period dependent demand including shortages under trade credit (2013) Optim Lett, 7 (5), pp. 1227-1249; Carlson, M.L., Rousseau, J.J., EOQ with date-terms supplier credit (1989) J Oper Res Soc, 40 (4), pp. 451-460; Chang, C.T., Teng, J.T., Goyal, S.K., Inventory lot-size models under trade credit: a review (2008) Asia Pac J Oper Res, 25 (1), pp. 89-112; Chen, S.-H., (2014) Cárdenas-Barrón LE, , Teng JT: Retailer’s economic order quantity when the supplier offers conditionally permissible delay in payments link to order quantity.

The latent process accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and correlation between individuals in a dynamic fashion, and for dependence between the observed process and the missing data mechanism. Of particular interest is the case where the missing mechanism is non-ignorable. To deal with the topic we introduce a conditional to dropout model. A shape change in the random effects distribution is considered by directly modeling the effect of the missing data process on the evolution of the latent structure. To estimate the resulting model, we rely on the conditional maximum likelihood approach and for this aim we outline an EM algorithm. The proposal is illustrated via simulations and then applied on a dataset concerning skin cancers.

Given “paired” demands between customer nodes, the PMPDP is to find a set of feasible vehicle routes starting from and ending at the depot such that the constructed objective function can be optimized subject to a set of desired constraints. When the PMPDP is applied to public library delivery operations, interchangeably used with the library vehicle routing problem (LVRP) hereafter, the customer nodes are replaced by library branches and the items to be delivered and picked up become books, videos and materials. To explore the LVRP, a mathematical model is rigorously formulated and a two-stage solution algorithm involving a modified bee colony optimization method is elaborately developed. Using real data from the San Francisco library system, the computational results show that our approach performs fairly well as compared with those approaches that have appeared in the literature. Provided each customer node is visited once, the sensitivity analysis indicates that when the number of dispatched library vehicles is more than what are needed, then the obtained result may get worse. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Logistics; Paired demands; Transportation; Vehicle routing,,"Agee, J., Naper, S., Off-site storage: an analysis (2007) Collect Build, 26 (1), pp. 20-25; Ai, T.J., Kachitvichyanukul, V., A particle swarm optimization for the vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36, pp. 1693-1702; Alvarado-Iniesta, A., Garcia-Alcaraz, J.L., Rodriguez-Borbon, M.I., Maldonado, A., Optimization of the material flow in a manufacturing plant by use of artificial bee colony algorithm (2013) Expert Syst Appl, 40, pp. 4785-4790; Apte, U.M., Mason, F.M., Analysis and improvement of delivery operations at the San Francisco public library (2006) J Oper Manag, 24, pp. 325-346; Attanasio, A., Cordeau, J.F., Ghiani, G., Laporte, G., Parallel Tabu search heuristics for the dynamic multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem (2004) Parallel Comput, 30, pp. 377-387; Ben-Akiva, M., Lerman, S., (1985) Discrete choice analysis: theory and application to travel demand, , MIT Press, Cambridge; Berbeglia, G., Cordeau, J.F., Laporte, G., Dynamic pickup and delivery problems (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202, pp. 8-15; Berry, J.N., III, The library Haines built (2005) Libr J, 130 (1), pp. 38-41; Bhagade, A.S., Puranik, P.V., Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for vehicle routing optimization problem (2012) Int J Soft Comput Eng, 2, pp. 329-333; Brajevic, I., Artificial bee colony algorithm for the capacitated vehicle routing problem.

Most of the procedures in the literature are least-squares-based methods with local polynomial approximation to nonparametric regression. However, the efficiency of these methods is adversely affected by outlying observations and heavy-tailed distributions. To attack this challenge, a robust testing procedure is recommended under the framework of the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLR) by incorporating with a Wilcoxon-type artificial likelihood function. Under the null hypothesis, the proposed test statistic is proved to be asymptotically normal and free of nuisance parameters and covariate designs. Its asymptotic relative efficiency with respect to the least-squares-based GLR method is closely related to that of the signed-rank Wilcoxon test in comparison with the (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.) test. We then consider a bootstrap approximation to determine (Formula presented.)(Formula presented.) values of the test in finite sample situation. Its asymptotic validity is also presented. A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed test and to compare it with its competitors in the literature. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bootstrap; Generalized likelihood ratio; Lack-of-fit test; Local polynomial regression; Local Walsh-average regression,,"Delgado, M.A., Testing the equality of nonparametric regression curves (1993) Stat Prob lett, 17, pp. 199-204; Dette, H., Munk, A., Testing heteroscedasticity in nonparametric regression (1998) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 60, pp. 693-708; Dette, H., Neumeyer, N., Nonparametric analysis of covariance (2001) Ann Stat, 29, pp. 1361-1400; Dette, H., Wagener, J., Volgushev, S., Comparing conditional quantile curves (2011) Scand J Stat, 38, pp. 63-88; Dette, H., Wagener, J., Volgushev, S., Nonparametric comparison of quantile curves: a stochastic process approach (2013) J Nonparametr Stat, 25, pp. 243-260; Fan, J., Local linear regression smoothers and their minimax efficiencies (1993) Ann Stat, 21, pp. 196-216; Fan, J., Gijbels, I., (1996) Local polynomial modelling and its applications, , Chapman and Hall, London:; Fan, J., Hu, T., Truong, Y., Robust nonparametric function estimation (1994) Scand J Stat, 21, pp. 433-446; Fan, J., Zhang, J., Sieve empirical likelihood ratio tests for nonparametric functions (2004) Ann Stat, 5, pp. 1858-1907; Fan, J., Zhang, C., Zhang, J., Generalized likelihood ratio statistics and Wilks phenomenon (2001) Ann Stat, 29, pp. 153-193; Feng, L., Zou, C., Wang, Z., Local Walsh-average regression (2012) J Multivar Anal, 106, pp. 36-48; Gueerre, E., Lavergne, P., Data-driven rate-optimal specification testing in regression models (2005) Ann Stat, 33, pp. 840-870; Hall, P., Hart, J.D., Bootstrap test for difference between means in nonparametric regression (1990) J Am Stat Assoc, 85, pp. 1039-1049; Hall, P., Huber, C., Speckman, P.L., Covariate-matched one-sided tests for the difference between functional means (1997) J Am Stat Assoc, 92, pp. 1074-1083; Härdle, W., Mammen, E., Comparing nonparametric versus parametric regression fits (1993) Ann Stat, 21, pp. 1926-1947; Hart, J.D., (1997) Nonparametric smoothing and lack-of-fit tests, , Springer, New York:; Hettmansperger, T.P., McKean, J.W., (1998) Robust nonparametric statistical methods, , Arnold, London:; Hodges, J.L., Lehmann, E.L., Estimates of location based on rank tests (1963) Ann Math Stat, 34, pp. 598-611; Horowitz, J.L., Spokoiny, V., An adaptive, rate-optimal test of a parametric mean regression model against a nonparametric alternative (2001) Econometrica, 69, pp. 599-631; Kai, B., Li, R., Zou, H., Local composite quantile regression smoothing: an efficient and safe alternative to local polynomial regression (2010) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 72, pp. 49-69; Kou, H.L., Sievers, G.L., McKean, J., An estimator of the scale parameter for the rank analysis of linear models under general score functions (1987) Scand J Stat, 14, pp. 131-141; Kulasekera, K.B., Comparison of regression curves using quasi-residuals (1995) J Am Stat Assoc, 90, pp. 1085-1093; Kulasekera, K.B., Wang, J., Smoothing parameter selection for power optimality in testing of regression curves (1997) J Am Stat Assoc, 92, pp. 500-511; Kuruwita, C., Gallagher, C., Kulasekera, K.B., Testing equality of nonparametric quantile regression functions (2014) Int J Stat Prob, 3, pp. 55-66; McKean, J.W., Hettmansperger, T.P., Tests of hypotheses of the general linear models based on ranks (1976) Commun Stat -Theor M, 5, pp. 693-709; Neumeyer, N., Dette, H., Nonparametric comparison of regression curves: an empirical process approach (2003) Ann Stat, 31, pp. 880-920; Pardo-Fernandez, J.C., Van Keilegom, I., Gonzalez-Manteiga, W., Testing for the equality of k regression curves (2007) Stat Sinica, 17, pp. 1115-1137; Robbins, M., Lund, R., Gallagher, C., Lu, X., Change-points in the North Atlantic tropical cyclone record (2011) J Am Stat Assoc, 106, pp. 89-99; Shang, S., Zou, C., Wang, Z., Local Walsh-average regression for semiparametric varying-coefficient models (2012) Stat Prob lett, 82, pp. 1815-1822; Stute, W., Zhu, L.X., Nonparametric checks for single-index models (2005) Ann Stat, 33, pp. 1048-1083; Terpstra, J., McKean, J., Rank-based analysis of linear models using R (2005) J Stat Softw, 14, pp. 1-26; Welsh, A.H., Robust estimation of smooth regression and spread functions and their derivatives (1996) Stat Sinica, 6, pp. 347-366; Zhang, C., Calibrating the degrees of freedom for automatic data smoothing and effective curve checking (2003) J Am Stat Assoc, 98, pp. 609-628; Zou, C., Liu, Y., Wang, Z., Zhang, R., Adaptive nonparametric comparison of regression curves (2010) Commun Stat Theor M, 39, pp. 1299-1320",English,Article

Two objective functions are simultaneously taken into account, minimization of mean completion time and minimization of earliness and tardiness costs. A robust model is presented to tackle the problem, based on goal programming and a stochastic programming model named E-model. The proposed model not only obtains optimal operating systems, but also considers the variance of the objective functions and the correlation between them. Moreover, chance-constrained programming model is used to take into account the randomness in the constraints of the model. The model is presented with general distribution of processing times and the normal case is explored in experiments. Two sets of computational experiments are presented to test the efficiency of the proposed model. In the first set, the performance obtained by the bi-objective formulation is measured, where in the second set the performance obtained by incorporating robustness is measured. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model, in both directions. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Earliness and tardiness costs; Goal programming; Mean completion time; Scheduling; Single machine; Stochastic programming,,"Baker, K.R., Scudder, G.D., Sequencing with earliness and tardiness penalties: A review (1990) Oper Res, 38, pp. 22-36; Baker, K.R., Trietsch, D., (2009) Principles of sequencing and scheduling, , Wiley, New Jersey; Benmansour, R., Allaoui, H., Artiba, A., Stochastic single machine scheduling with random common due date (2012) Int J Prod Res, 50, pp. 3560-3571; Birge, J.R., Louveaux, F., (1997) Introduction to stochastic programming, , Springer, New York; Cai, X., Zhou, S., Scheduling stochastic jobs with asymmetric earliness and tardiness penalties (1997) Naval Res Logist, 44, pp. 531-557; Cai, X., Zhou, S., Asymmetric earliness and tardiness scheduling with exponential processing times on an unreliable machine (2000) Ann Oper Res, 98, pp. 313-331; Chang, P.C., A branch and bound approach for single machine scheduling with earliness and tardiness penalties (1999) Comput Math Appl, 37, pp. 133-144; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Chance-constrained programming (1959) Manage Sci, 6, pp. 73-79; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., (1961) Management models and industrial applications of linear programming, , Wiley, New York; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Deterministic equivalents for optimizing and satisficing under chance constraints (1963) Oper Res, 11, pp. 18-39; Chen, H., Chu, C., Proth, J.M., Single machine scheduling to minimize total weighted earliness and tardiness with different due dates (1996) Operations research proceedings, 1995, pp. 138-143. , Springer, Berlin; Cheng, T.C.E., Kahlbacher, H.G., A proof for the longest-job-first policy in one-machine scheduling (1991) Naval Res Logist, 38, pp. 715-720; Diaz-Garcia, J.A., Ramos-Quiroga, R., Cabrera-Vicencio, E., Stochastic programming methods in the response surface methodology (2005) Computat Stat Data Anal, 49, pp. 837-848; Hoogeveen, H., Multicriteria scheduling (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 167, pp. 592-623; Ignizio, J.P., A review of goal programming: a tool for multiobjective analysis (1978) J Oper Res Soc, 29, pp. 1109-1119; Kedad-Sidhoum, S., Sourd, F., Fast neighborhood search for the single machine earliness-tardiness scheduling problem (2010) Comput Oper Res, 37, pp. 1464-1471; Keha, A.B., Khowala, K., Fowler, J.W., Mixed integer programming formulations for single machine scheduling problems (2009) Comput Ind Eng, 56, pp. 357-367; Lasserre, J.B., Queyranne, M., Generic scheduling polyhedral and a new mixed-integer formulation for single-machine scheduling.

Although ASN distribution is able to model both skew and bimodal data, it is shortcoming when data has thinner or thicker tails than normal. Therefore, we propose an alpha-skew generalized t (ASGT) by using the generalized t (GT) distribution and a new skewing procedure. From this point of view, ASGT can be seen as an alternative skew version of GT distribution. However, ASGT differs from the previous skew versions of GT distribution since it is able to model bimodal data sest as well as it nests most commonly used density functions. In this paper, moments and maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of ASGT distribution are given. Skewness and kurtosis measures are derived based on the first four noncentral moments.

We extend the results given by other authors for the scalar case to vectorial one, and we show the equivalence of efficient and weak efficient solutions for the multiobjective continuous-time programming problem, and solutions of Stampacchia and Minty variational-like type inequality problems. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept of generalized invexity for continuous-time programming problems, namely, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT)-pseudoinvexity-II. We prove that this new concept is a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector KKT solution to be an efficient solution for a multiobjective continuous-time programming problem. In this work, duality results for Mond–Weir type dual problems are obtained, using generalized KKT-pseudoinvexity-II.

Then, we propose a semiparametric regression model suitable for data set analysis in which the distribution of the response is strictly positive and asymmetric. In this setup, both median and skewness of the response variable distribution are explicitly modeled, the median using a parametric non-linear function and the skewness using a semiparametric function. The proposed model allows for the description of the response using the log-symmetric distribution, which is a generalization of the log-normal distribution and is flexible enough to consider bimodal distributions in special cases as well as distributions having heavier or lighter tails than those of the log-normal one. An iterative estimation process as well as some diagnostic methods are derived. Two data sets previously analyzed under parametric models are reanalyzed using the proposed methodology. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymmetric responses; Maximum penalized likelihood estimates; Natural cubic spline; Robust estimates; Semiparametric models; Skewness,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) International symposium on information theory, pp. 267-281. , Petrov BN, Csaki F, (eds), Akademiai Kiado Budapest, Hungary:; Andrews, D.R., Mallows, C.L., Scale mixtures of normal distributions (1974) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 36, pp. 99-102; Barndoff-Nielsen, O., Exponentially decreasing distributions for the logarithm of particle size (1977) Proc R Soc Lond A Math, 353, pp. 401-419; Birnbaum, Z.W., Saunders, S.C., A new family of life distributions (1969) J Appl Probab, 6, pp. 319-327; Box, G.E.P., Tiao, G.C., Bayesian inference in statistical analysis.

However, often non-sampling errors are more influential to the properties of the estimator than sampling errors. This is recognized by practitioners, researchers and many great works of literature regarding non-sampling errors have been published during last two decades, especially regarding non-response error which is one of the cornerstones of the non-sampling errors. The literature handles one kind of non-sampling error at a time, although in real surveys more than one non-sampling error is usually present.In this paper, two kinds of non-sampling errors are considered at the estimation stage: non-response and measurement error. An exponential ratio type estimator has been developed to estimate the population mean of the response variable in the presence of non-response and measurement errors. Theoretically and empirically, it has been shown that the proposed estimator is more efficient than usual unbiased estimator and other existing estimators. © 2015 Revista Colombiana de Estadística.",Estimation; Mean squared error; Measurement error; Nonresponse; Ratio estimator; Sampling error,,"Allen, J., Singh, H., Smarandache, F., A family of estimators of population mean using multi-auxiliary information in presence of measurement errors (2003) International Journal of Social Economics, 30, pp. 837-849; Binder, D.A., Design-based estimation (2008) Encyclopedia of Survey Research Methods, pp. 192-194. , in P.

As the human intuitions implies, it is not rational to measure the distance between two fuzzy clusters by a crisp measurement. Unfortunately, most of the existing fuzzy clustering approaches, consider the distance between two fuzzy clusters as a crisp value. This will yield a rounding error and is assumed a pitfall. In this paper, an efficient fuzzy distance measurement is developed in order to measure distance between multi-dimensional fuzzy clusters as a fuzzy measure. The triangle fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are used to develop the applicable fuzzy clustering approach. Then, multi-objective mathematical programming is utilized to optimize the center, and left and right spreads of fuzzy clusters which are calculated as TFNs. More formally, the advantages of proposed fuzzy clustering in comparison with existing procedure is (a) developing an efficient fuzzy distance measurement, and (b) optimizing the center and spread of the fuzzy clusters using multi-objective mathematical programming. An illustrative random simulated instance is supplied in order to present the mechanism and calculations of the proposed fuzzy clustering approach. The performance of proposed fuzzy clustering approach is compared with an existing Fuzzy C-means approach in the literature on several benchmark instances. Then, the Error Ratio is defined to compare the performance of both methods and comprehensive statistical analysis and hypothesis test are accomplished to test the performance of both methods. Finally, a real case study, called group decision making multi-possibility multi-choice investment partitioning problem, is discussed in order to illustrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed approach in real world problems. The proposed approach is straightforward, its quality is as well as existing approach in the literature and its results are promising. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy distance measurement; Investment selection; Multi-objective programming,,"Ahmed, M.N., Yamany, S.M., Mohamed, N., Farag, A.A., Moriarty, T., A modified fuzzy C-means algorithm for bias field estimation and segmentation of MRI data (2002) IEEE Trans Med Imaging, 21 (3), pp. 193-199; Alp Erilli, N., Yolcu, U., Eriolu, E., Öner, Y., Determining the most proper number of cluster in fuzzy clustering by using artificial neural networks (2011) Expert Syst Appl, 38, pp. 2248-2252; Baraldi, A., Blonda, P., A survey of fuzzy clustering algorithms for pattern recognition.

We propose an imperfect quality inventory model with overlapped and advanced receiving in which the supplier provides a discount rate of procurement cost to compensate the buyer for the additional holding cost and maintain a cooperative relationship. As we expected, a lot sizing policy with overlapped and advanced receiving is developed to generalize the current literature models. It should be noted that the classical EOQ model and Maddah et al’s work (Comput Ind Eng 58:691–695, 2010) are two special cases of our model. A numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed model. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is made to investigate the effects of five important parameters on the optimal lot size and the expected total profit per cycle.

"Lin T.-I., Wu P.H., McLachlan G.J., Lee S.X.",A robust factor analysis model using the restricted skew-t distribution,2015,Test,510,531,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938968077&partnerID=40&md5=64fe88cf7a2a8669595c5f7ac4e909e7,"Factor analysis is a classical data-reduction technique that seeks a potentially lower number of unobserved variables that can account for the correlations among the observed variables. This paper presents an extension of the factor analysis model, called the skew-$$t$$t factor analysis model, constructed by assuming a restricted version of the multivariate skew-$$t$$t distribution for the latent factors and a symmetric $$t$$t-distribution for the unobservable errors jointly. The proposed model shows robustness to violations of normality assumptions of the underlying latent factors and provides flexibility in capturing extra skewness as well as heavier tails of the observed data. A computationally feasible expectation conditional maximization algorithm is developed for computing maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters. The usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated using both simulated and real data. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",ECM algorithm; ML estimation; rMSN distribution; rMST distribution; SNFA model; STFA model,,"Aas, K., Haff, I.H., The generalised hyperbolic skew student’s t-distribution (2006) J Financ Econ, 4, pp. 275-309; Aitken, A.C., On Bernoulli’s numerical solution of algebraic equations (1926) Proc R Soc Edinburgh, 46, pp. 289-305; Akaike, H., Petrov, B.N., Csaki, F., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1973) 2nd international symposium on information theory, pp. 267-281. , Akademiai Kiado, Budapest; Anderson, T.W., (2003) An introduction to multivariate statistical analysis, , Wiley, New York; Azzalini, A., A class of distributions which includes the normal ones (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Azzalini, A., The skew-normal distribution and related multivariate families (2005) Scand J Stat, 32, pp. 159-188; Azzalini, A., Capitanio, A., Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distribution (1999) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 61, pp. 579-602; Azzalini, A., Capitanio, A., Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew t-distribution (2003) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 65, pp. 367-389; Azzalini, A., Dalla Valle, A., The multivariate skew-normal distribution (1996) Biometrika, 83, pp. 715-726; Azzalini, A., Genton, M.G., Robust likelihood methods based on the skew-t and related distributions (2008) Int Stat Rev, 76, pp. 106-129; Barndorff-Nielsen, O., Shephard, N., Non-Gaussian Ornstein–Uhlenbeck-based models and some of their uses in financial economics (2001) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 63, pp. 167-241; Basilevsky, A., (2008) Statistical factor analysis and related methods: theory and applications, , Wiley, New York; Böhning, D., Dietz, E., Schaub, R., Schlattmann, P., Lindsay, B., The distribution of the likelihood ratio for mixtures of densities from the one-parameter exponential family (1994) Ann Inst Stat Math, 46, pp. 373-388; Bozdogan, H., Model selection and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC): the general theory and its analytical extensions (1987) Psychometrika, 52, pp. 345-370; Branco, M.D., Dey, D.K., A general class of multivariate skew-elliptical distributions (2001) J Multivar Anal, 79, pp. 99-113; Cook, R.D., Weisberg, S., (1994) An introduction to regression graphics, , Wiley, New York; Dempster, A.P., Laird, N.M., Rubin, D.B., Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM algorithm (with discussion) (1977) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 39, pp. 1-38; Efron, B., Hinkley, D.V., Assessing the accuracy of the maximum likelihood estimator: observed versus expected fisher information (with discussion) (1978) Biometrika, 65, pp. 457-487; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R., Bootstrap method for standard errors, confidence intervals, and other measures of statistical accuracy (1986) Stat Sci, 1, pp. 54-77; Fokoué, E., Titterington, D.M., Mixtures of factor analyzers.

We here propose two alternative formulations to achieve identification when the assumptions underlying the use of IV are violated. Parallel to the IV, the proposed formulas exploit the conditional independence structure of a directed acyclic graph and can be obtained via a series of univariate regressions, a feature that renders the results particularly attractive and easy to implement. By exploiting the notion of Markov equivalence, the derivations can also be applied to regression graphs, thereby enlarging the class of models to which the results are of use. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Causal effect; Confounder; Directed acyclic graph; Identification; Latent variable; Regression graph; Structural equation model,,"Allman, E.S., Matias, C., Rhodes, J.A., Identifiability parameters in latent structure models with many observed variables (2009) Ann Stat, 37, pp. 3099-3132; Bollen, K., (1989) Structural equation models, , Wiley, New York; Bowden, R., The theory of parametric identification (1973) Econometrica, 41, pp. 1069-1074; Bowden, R., Darrel, A.T., (1984) Instrumental variables, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brito, C., Pearl, J., Generalized instrumental variables, Technical report (2002) R-303; Cai, Z., Kuroki, M., On identifying total effects in the presence of latent variables and selection bias (2012) Proceedings of the twenty-fourth conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI-08) pp 62–69; Chan, H., Kuroki, M., Using descendants as instrumental variables for the identification of directed causal effects in linear SEMs (2010) J Mach Learn Res, 9, pp. 73-80; Coleman, J.S., Hoffer, T., Kilgore, S., (1982) High school achievement: public, catholic, and private schools compared, , Basic Books, New York; Cox, D.R., Wermuth, N., (1996) Multivariate dependencies-models, analysis and interpretation, , Chapman & Hall, London; Frydenberg, M., The chain graph Markov property (1990) Scand J Stat, 17, pp. 333-353; Huang, Y., Valtorta, M., Pearls calculus of intervention is complete (2006) Proceedings of the twenty-second conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI-06) pp 217–224; Kuroki, M., Graphical identifiability criteria for causal effect in studies with an unobserved treatment/response variable (2007) Biometrika, 94, pp. 37-47; Kuroki, M., Pearl, J., Measurement bias and effect restoration in causal inference (2014) Biometrika, 101, pp. 423-437; Lauritzen, S.L., (1996) Graphical models, , Oxford Science Publication, Oxford; Lauritzen, S.L., Barndoff-Nielsen, O.E., Cox, D.R., Klüpperberg, C., Causal inference from graphical models (2001) Complex stochastic system, pp. 63-107. , CRC Press, London; Morgan, S.L., Winship, C., (2007) Counterfactuals and causal inference: methods and principles for social research, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Pakpahan, E., Essays on causal inference in Gaussian graphical models (2012) PhD thesis, , University of Perugia, Available from the author by emailing to epakpahan@gmail.com; Pearl, J., Causal diagrams for empirical research (1995) Biometrika, 82, pp. 669-709; Pearl, J., Statistics and causal inference: a review (2001) TEST, 12, pp. 281-345; Pearl, J., (2009) Causality: models, reasoning, and inference, 2nd edn., , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Rothenberg, T.J., Identification in parametric models (1971) Econometrica, 39, pp. 577-591; Shpitser, I., Pearl, J., Complete identification methods for the causal hierarchy (2008) J Mach Learn Res, 9, pp. 1941-1979; Stanghellini, E., Instrumental variables in Gaussian directed acyclic graph models with an unobserved confounder (2004) Environmetrics, 15, pp. 463-469; Stanghellini, E., Vantaggi, B., On the identification of discrete concentration graph models with one hidden binary variable (2013) Bernoulli, 19, pp. 1920-1937; Stanghellini, E., Wermuth, N., On the identification of path analysis models with one hidden variable (2005) Biometrika, 92, pp. 337-350; Theil, H., Repeated least square applied to complete equation systems (1953) Central Planning Bureau, , The Hague, The Netherlands; Tian, J., Pearl J (2002) A general identification condition for causal effects Proceedings of the eighteenth national conference on artificial intelligence, pp. 567-573. , AAAI Press/The MIT Press, Menlo Park, CA; Verma, T., Pearl, J., Equivalence and synthesis of causal models (1991) Proceedings of the sixth annual conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI, 90, pp. 255-270; Wermuth, N., Cox, D.R., Distortion of effects caused by indirect confounding (2008) Biometrika, 95, pp. 17-33; Wermuth, N., Sadeghi, K., Sequences of regressions and their independences (2011) TEST, 21, pp. 215-252",English,Article

In contrast to what happens when dealing with real random variables, for complex random variables it is shown that it is possible to obtain closed-form expressions for the exact distributions of the LRT statistics to test independence, equality of mean vectors and the equality of an expected value matrix to a given matrix. For the LRT statistics to test sphericity and the equality of covariance matrices, cases where the exact distribution has a non-manageable expression, easy to implement and very accurate near-exact distributions are developed. Numerical studies show how these near-exact distributions outperform by far any other available approximations. As an example of application of the results obtained, the authors develop a near-exact approximation for the distribution of the LRT statistic to test the equality of several complex normal distributions. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Covariance matrix; Equality of covariance matrices; Equality of mean vectors; Expected value matrix; Fourier transforms; Generalized integer gamma (GIG) distribution; Generalized near-integer gamma (GNIG) distribution; Independence; Mixtures; Sphericity; Statistical distributions (distribution functions),,"Anderson, T.W., (2003) An introduction to multivariate statistical analysis, , Wiley, New York; Box, G.E.P., A general distribution theory for a class of likelihood criteria (1949) Biometrika, 36, pp. 317-346; Brillinger, D.R., (2001) Time series: data analysis and theory, , SIAM, Philadelphia; Brillinger, D.R., Krishnaiah, P.R., Handbook of statistics.

While multi-level clustered data models can arise in practice, analysis of multi-level clustered data models poses additional difficulties owing to the existence of error correlations both within and across the clusters. It is perhaps for this reason that existing approaches to multi-level clustered data models have been mostly parametric. The purpose of this paper is to develop a varying-coefficient nonparametric approach to the analysis of three-level clustered data models. Because the nonparametric functions are restricted only to some of the variables, this approach has the appeal of avoiding many of the curse of dimensionality problems commonly associated with other nonparametric methods. By applying an undersmoothing technique, taking into account the correlations within and across clusters, we develop an efficient two-stage local polynomial estimation procedure for the unknown coefficient functions. The large and finite sample properties of the resultant estimators are examined; in particular, we show that the resultant estimators are asymptotically normal, and exhibit considerably smaller asymptotic variability than the traditional local polynomial estimators that neglect the correlations within and among clusters. An application example is presented based on a data set extracted from the World Bank’s STARS database. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic normality; Clustered data; Correlation; Nonparametric; Two-stage estimation,,"Baltagi, B.H., (2008) Econometric analysis of panel data, , Wiley, New York; Beierlein, J.G., Dunn, J.W., McConnon, J.R., The demand for electricity and natural gas in the northeastern United States (1981) Rev Econ Stat, 63, pp. 403-408; Chapman, A.B., Guay-Woodford, L.M., Grantham, J.J., Torres, V.E., Bae, K.T., Baumgarten, D.A., Kenney, P.J., Miller, J.P., Renal structure in early autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): the Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease (CRISP) cohort (2003) Kidney Int, 64, pp. 1035-1045; Chen, S., Zhong, P., ANOVA for longitudinal data with missing values (2011) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 3630-3659; Cleveland, W.S., Gross, E., Shhyu, W.M., Hastie, T.J., Local regression models (1991) Statistical models in S Chambers JM, pp. 309-376. , Wadsworth and Brooks, Pacific Grove; Diggle, P.J., Liang, K.Y., Zeger, S.L., (1994) Analysis of longitudinal data, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Fan, J., Gijbels, I., (1996) Local polynomial modelling and its applications, , Chapman and Hall, London; Fan, J., Huang, T., Li, R., Analysis of longitudinal data with semiparametric estimation of covariance function (2007) J Am Stat Assoc, 35, pp. 632-641; Fan, J., Zhang, J., Two-step estimation of functional linear models with applications to longitudinal data (2000) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 62, pp. 303-322; Hastie, T., Tibshiran, R., Varying-coefficient models (1993) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 55, pp. 757-796; Hoover, D.R., Rice, J.A., Wu, C.O., Yang, L., Nonparametric smoothing estimates of time-varying coefficient models with longitudinal data (1998) Biometrika, 85, pp. 809-822; Lin, X., Carroll, R.J., Semiparametric estimation in general repeated measures problems (2006) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 68, pp. 69-88; Tsay, W.J., Testing for contemporaneous correlation of disturbances in seemingly unrelated regressions with serial dependence (2004) Econ Lett, 83, pp. 69-76; Wan, G., Griffiths, W.E., Anderson, J.R., Using panel data to estimate risk effects in seemingly unrelated production functions (1992) Empir Econ, 17, pp. 35-49; Wang, N., Marginal nonparametric kernel regression accounting for within-subject correlation (2003) Biometrika, 90, pp. 43-52; Welsh, A., Lin, X., Carroll, R.J., Marginal longitudinal nonparametric regression: locality and efficiency of Spline and Kernel methods (2002) J Am Stat Assoc, 97, pp. 482-493; Zellner, A., An efficient method of estimating seemingly unrelated regressions and tests for aggregation bias (1962) J Am Stat Assoc, 57, pp. 348-368; Zhang, W., Fan, J., Sun, Y., A semiparametric model for cluster data (2009) Ann Stat, 37, pp. 2377-2408; Zhou, B., You, J., Xu, Q., Efficient estimation for error component seemingly unrelated nonparametric regression models (2011) Metrika, 73, pp. 121-138",English,Article

An advantage of the power-normal distribution is its simple distribution function, easy to deal with in censored situations. The likelihood approach is considered for parameter estimation and model comparison.

Incoming calls arrive at system according to a Poisson process. Service times of incoming calls follow the exponential distribution. Incoming calls that find the server busy upon arrival join an orbit and retry after some exponentially distributed time. On the other hand, the server makes an outgoing call after some exponentially distributed idle time. We assume that there are multiple types of outgoing calls whose durations follow distinct exponential distributions. For this model, we obtain explicit expressions for the joint stationary distribution of the number of calls in the orbit and the state of the server via the generating function approach. We also obtain simple asymptotic and recursive formulae for the joint stationary distribution. We show a stochastic decomposition property where we prove that the number of incoming calls in the system (server and orbit) can be decomposed into the sum of three independent random variables which have a clear physical meaning. We then consider the multiserver model for which we obtain the stability condition and derive some exact formulae by mean value analysis. Finally, we extend the single server model to the case where service time distribution of incoming calls and that of each type of outgoing calls are arbitrary. For this case, we obtain explicit expressions for the partial generating functions and recursive formulae for the joint stationary distribution of the server’s state and the number of calls in the orbit. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Embedded Markov chain; Multiple classes; Retrial queues; Stability condition; Two-way communication,,"Artalejo, J.R., Accessible bibliography on retrial queues: progress in 2000–2009 (2010) Math Comput Modell, 51, pp. 1071-1081; Artalejo, J.R., Falin, G.I., Stochastic decomposition for retrial queues (1994) Top, 2, pp. 329-342; Artalejo, J.R., Gomez-Corral, A., (2008) Retrial Queueing systems: a computational approach, , Springer, Berlin; Artalejo, J.R., Phung-Duc, T., Markovian retrial queues with two way communication (2012) J Indust Manag Opt, 8, pp. 781-806; Artalejo, J.R., Phung-Duc, T., Single server retrial queues with two way communication (2013) Appl Math Modell, 37, pp. 1811-1822; Avram, F., Chedom, D.F., On symbolic RG factorization of quasi-birth-and-death processes (2011) Top, 19, pp. 317-335; Bhulai, S., Koole, G., A queueing model for call blending in call centers (2003) IEEE Trans Automat Contr, 48, pp. 1434-1438; Choi, B.D., Choi, K.B., Lee, Y.W., M/G/1 retrial queueing systems with two types of calls and finite capacity (1995) Queueing syst, 19, pp. 215-229; Cinlar, E., (1975) Introduction to Stochastic Processes, , Prentince-Hall, Englewood Cliffs; Deslauriers, A., L’Ecuyer, P., Pichitlamken, J., Ingolfsson, A., Avramidis, A.N., Markov chain models of a telephone call center with call blending (2007) Comput Oper Res, 34, pp. 1616-1645; Dimitriou, I., A modified vacation queueing model and its application on the discontinuous reception power saving mechanism in unreliable Long Term Evolution networks (2014) Perform Evalu, 77, pp. 37-56; Falin, G.I., Model of coupled switching in presence of recurrent calls (1979) Eng Cybern Rev, 17, pp. 53-59; Falin, G.I., Artalejo, J.R., Martin, M., On the single server retrial queue with priority customers (1993) Queueing Syst, 14, pp. 439-455; Falin, G.I., Templeton, J.G.C., Retrial queues (1997) Chapman & Hall; Flajolet, P., Sedgewick, R., (2009) Analytic combinatorics, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Martin, M., Artalejo, J.R., Analysis of an M/G/1 queue with two types of impatient units (1995) Adv Appl Prob, 27, pp. 840-861; Krishnamoorthy, A., Pramod, P.K., Chakravarthy, S.R., Queues with interruptions: a survey (2014) Top, 22, pp. 290-320; Phung-Duc, T., Masuyama, H., Kasahara, S., Takahashi, Y., Performance analysis of optical burst switched networks with limited-range wavelength conversion, retransmission and burst segmentation (2009) J Oper Res Socf Jpn, 52, pp. 58-74; Phung-Duc, T., Masuyama, H., Kasahara, S., Takahashi, Y., M/M/3/3 and M/M/4/4 retrial queues (2009) J Indust Manag Opt, 5, pp. 431-451; Phung-Duc, T., Masuyama, H., Kasahara, S., Takahashi, Y., A simple algorithm for the rate matrices of level-dependent QBD processes.

By using these inequalities, we further study the complete convergence for weighted sums of arrays of row-wise WOD random variables and give some special cases, which extend some corresponding ones for dependent sequences. As applications, we present some sufficient conditions to prove the complete consistency for the estimator of nonparametric regression model based on WOD errors by using the complete convergence that we established. At last, the choice of the fixed design points and the weight functions for the nearest neighbor estimates is proposed.

Specially, we characterize the generalized mixture of two Weibull components. In addition, some reliability properties are established for these generalized two-component Weibull mixture models.

Metrics such as Hellinger distance and negative exponential disparity have a long history in robust estimation in frequentist inference. We demonstrate that an equivalent robustification may be made in Bayesian inference by substituting an appropriately scaled disparity for the log likelihood to which standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods may be applied. A particularly appealing property of minimum-disparity methods is that while they yield robustness with a breakdown point of 1/2, the resulting parameter estimates are also efficient when the posited probabilistic model is correct. We demonstrate that a similar property holds for disparity-based Bayesian inference. We further show that in the Bayesian setting, it is also possible to extend these methods to robustify regression models, random effects distributions and other hierarchical models. These models require integrating out a random effect; this is achieved via MCMC but would otherwise be numerically challenging. The methods are demonstrated on real-world data. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian inference; Deviance test; Hellinger distance; Kernel density; MCMC; Negative exponential disparity; Outliers; Posterior,,"Albert, J., LearnBayes: functions for learning Bayesian inference (2008) R package version, p. 2; Albert, J., (2009) Bayesian computation with R, , Springer, New York; Andrade, J.A.A., O’Hagan, A., Bayesian robustness modeling using regularly varying distributions (2006) Bayesian Anal, 1 (1), pp. 169-188; Basu, A., Sarkar, S., Vidyashankar, A.N., Minimum negative exponential disparity estimation in parametric models (1997) J Stat Plan Inference, 58, pp. 349-370; Basu, A., Shioya, H., Park, C., Statistical inference, monographs on statistics and applied probability (2011) vol 120, , CRC Press, Boca Raton (the minimum distance approach; Beran, R., Minimum Hellinger distance estimates for parametric models (1977) Ann Stat, 5, pp. 445-463; Berger, J.O., An overview of robust Bayesian analysis (1994) TEST, 3, pp. 5-124; Cheng, A.L., Vidyashankar, A.N., Minimum Hellinger distance estimation for randomized play the winner design (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 1875-1910; Choy, S.T.B., Smith, A.F.M., On robust analysis of a normal location parameter (1997) J Royal Stat Soc B, 59, pp. 463-474; Dawid, A.P., Posterior expectations for large observations (1973) Biometrika, 60, pp. 664-667; Desgagnè, A., Angers, J.F., Confilicting information and location parameter inference (2007) Metron, 65, pp. 67-97; Devroye, L., Györfi, G., (1985) Nonparametric density estimation: the L1 view, , Wiley, New York; Dey, D.K., Birmiwal, L.R., Robust Bayesian analysis using divergence measures (1994) Stat Prob Lett, 20, pp. 287-294; Dunson, D.B., Taylor, J.A., Approximate bayesian inference for quantiles (2005) J Nonparametr Stat, 17 (3), pp. 385-400; Engel, J., Herrmann, E., Gasser, T., An iterative bandwidth selector for kernel estimation of densities and their derivatives (1994) J Nonparametr Stat, 4, p. 2134; Ghosh, J.K., Delampady, M., Samanta, T., (2006) An introduction to Bayesian analysis, , Springer, New York; Hampel, F.R., The influence curve and its role in robust estimation (1974) J Am Stat Assoc, 69, pp. 383-393; Hampel, F.R., Ronchetti, E.M., Rousseeuw, P.J., Stahel, W.A., Robust statistics (1986) Wiley Series in probability and mathematical statistics: probability and mathematical statistics, , Wiley, New York (the approach based on influence functions; http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/papers/ncde, Hansen BE (2004) Nonparametric conditional density estimation.

As alternatives to the standard normal model, multivariate NST models are composed by a fixed univariate stable Tweedie variable having a positive value domain, and the remaining random variables given the fixed one are real independent Gaussian variables with the same variance equal to the fixed component. Within the framework of exponential dispersion models, a new form of variance functions is firstly established. Then, their generalized variance functions are shown to be powers of only the fixed mean component. Their modified Lévy measures are generally of the normal gamma type, which is connected to NST models through some Monge–Ampère equations. Two kinds of generalized variance estimators are discussed and variance modelling under only observations of normal terms is evoked. Finally, reasonable extensions of NST to multiple stable Tweedie models and corresponding problems are presented. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Covariance matrix; Determinant; Generalized variance estimator; Lévy measure; Monge–Ampère equation; Multivariate exponential dispersion model,,"Alfaro, J.L., Ortega, J.F., Robust Hotelling’s (Formula presented.) control charts under non-normality: the case of (Formula presented.)-Student distribution (2012) J Stat Comput Simul, 82, pp. 1437-1447; Antoniadis, A., Besbeas, P., Sapatinas, T., Wavelet shrinkage for natural exponential families with cubic variance functions (2001) Sankhya A, 63, pp. 309-327; Bar-Lev, S., Bschouty, D., Enis, P., Letac, G., Lu, I., Richard, D., The diagonal multivariate natural exponential families and their classification (1994) J Theor Probab, 7, pp. 883-929; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Normal inverse Gaussian distribution and stochastic volatility modelling (1997) Scand J Stat, 24, pp. 1-13; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Processes of normal inverse Gaussian type (1998) Financ Stoch, 2, pp. 41-68; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Shephard, N., Normal modified stable processes (2002) Theory Probab Math Stat, 65, pp. 1-19; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Kent, J., Sørensen, M., Normal variance-mean mixtures and z distributions (1982) Int Stat Rev, 50, pp. 145-159; Bernardo, J.M., Smith, A.F.M., (1993) Bayesian theory, , Wiley, New York; Bernardoff, P., Kokonendji, C.C., Puig, B., Generalized variance estimators in the multivariate gamma models (2008) Math Methods Stat, 17, pp. 66-73; Casalis, M., The (Formula presented.) simple quadratic natural exponential families on (Formula presented.)

García-Pérez A.,The p value line: a way to choose the tuning constant in tests based on the Huber (Formula presented.)-estimator,2014,Test,536,555,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957841631&partnerID=40&md5=dc37a987cd03d710335d5aee9b642515,"In this paper, we propose a method to choose a test result from several competing ones. The choice is based on the p value under the alternative, i.e., the probability of obtaining an extreme or a more extreme result than the one actually observed, assuming that the alternative hypothesis is true. The function obtained, by moving the alternative, is called the p value line. Because this combines the power of a test and its sensitivity to outliers, it is considered to be the basis for the selection between several classical and/or robust test results. When we change the trimming fraction in the trimmed mean, or the tuning constant when we consider a test based on the Huber (Formula presented.)-estimator, we obtain competing robust test results. For this reason, we can use the p value line to choose the trimming fraction or the tuning constant in an objective way. In this article, we shall focus on the second class of estimators. Because computing the distribution of the test statistic under the alternative could be a very hard problem, a linear approximation of the tail probability functional based on the von Mises expansion can be used to compute the p value line. Applications of the proposal to the one-sample location problem, generalized linear models and generalized additive models are considered in the article. We conclude the article with the random p value line to decide if the observed differences between p value lines are significant or not. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Huber (Formula presented.)-estimator; p value; Robustness in hypothesis testing; Tuning constant; Von Mises expansion,,"Alimadad, A., Salibian-Barrera, M., An outlier-robust fit for generalized additive models with applications to disease outbreak detection (2011) J Am Stat Assoc, 106, pp. 719-731; Bahadur, R.R., Stochastic comparison of tests (1960) Ann Math Stat, 31, pp. 276-295; Bhattacharya, B., Habtzghi, D., Median of the (Formula presented.) value under the alternative hypothesis (2002) Am Stat, 56, pp. 202-206; Cantoni, E., Ronchetti, E., Robust inference for generalized linear models (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96, pp. 1022-1030; Dehon, C., Gassner, M., Verardi, V., A new Hausman type test to detect the presence of influential outliers (2009) Econ Lett, 105, pp. 64-67; Dehon, C., Gassner, M., Verardi, V., Test for outlier detection and optimal choice of efficiency for MM-regression estimators (2010) In: Proceedings of the 3rd international conference of the ERCIM working group on computing & statistics (ERCIM’10); Dehon, C., Gassner, M., Verardi, V., Extending the Hausman test to check for the presence of outliers (2011) Ecares working paper; Dempster, A.P., Schatzoff, M., Expected significance level as a sensitivity index for test statistics (1965) J Am Stat Assoc, 60, pp. 420-436; Field, C.A., Ronchetti, E.M., A tail area influence function and its application to testing (1985) Commun Stat, 4, pp. 19-41; García-Pérez, A., Another look at the tail area influence function (2011) Metrika, 73, pp. 77-92; García-Pérez, A., A linear approximation to the power function of a test (2012) Metrika, 75, pp. 855-875; García-Pérez, A., Kruse, R., Berthold, M.R., Moewes, C., Gil, M.A., Grzegorzewski, P., Hryniewicz, O., The p-value line: a way to choose from different test results.

The objectives of this paper are twofold. First, we want to correct and improve the recently studied model by optimizing the review period, back-order price discount, target level and lead time simultaneously to achieve significant savings in the total related cost and higher service level. Second, we consider that the demands of the different customers are not identical in the protection interval to accommodate more practical features of the real inventory systems. For the proposed model, a computational algorithm with the help of the software Mathematica 7 is furnished to derive the optimal solution.

Given the covariates, the conditional mean function is modeled as a partial linear model, and the conditional distribution function of model error is modeled as a single-index model. To estimate the single-index parameter, we propose a semi-parametric global weighted least-squares estimator coupled with an indicator function of the residuals. We derive a residual-based kernel estimator to estimate the unknown conditional distribution function. Asymptotic distributions of the proposed estimators are derived, and the residual-based kernel process constructed by the estimator of the conditional distribution function is shown to converge to a Gaussian process. Simulation studies are conducted and a real dataset is analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed estimators. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Conditional distribution function; Empirical process; Kernel smoothing; Partial linear models; Single-index,,,English,Article in Press

An important component of designing PFX treatments is the selection of points in the target structure at which to focus the radiation, called isocentres. This study applies skeletonization methods to select such isocentres. Our skeletonization technique identifies clusters of each target structure’s skeleton using distance coding methods. A user-defined number of isocentre locations are chosen from the skeletal clusters. The isocentres resulting from this approach are used as input to a sector duration optimization model that determines the optimal shot shapes and intensities for the radiation deposited at each isocentre. The results for seven clinical cases are presented. For each case, target structure dose and conformity meet clinical radiosurgery guidelines, while brainstem dose is kept to acceptable levels and other healthy organs are also spared. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Distance coding; Gamma Knife Perfexion; Isocentre; Radiosurgery; Skeletonization,,"Arcelli, C., Cordella, L., Levialdi, S., A grassfire transformation for binary digital pictures.

It is assumed that uncertainty is adequately captured via a finite set of scenarios. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. The goal is to minimize the total cost associated with the selected links plus the expected transportation and fixed handling costs. A prototype problem is initially presented which is then progressively extended to accommodate capacities at the origins and multiple commodities. The results of an extensive set of computational tests are reported and discussed. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Fixed handling costs; Stochastic demands; Transportation; Two-stage stochastic programming,,,English,Article in Press

The state space is denumerable and the action space is a Borel set, while the cost functions are admitted to be unbounded from below and above. Under suitable conditions weaker than those in (Alvarez-Mena and Hernández-Lerma, Math Methods Oper Res 63:261-285, 2006) for bounded cost functions, we also show the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the constrained games by introducing two approximations. The first one, which is as in (Alvarez-Mena and Hernández-Lerma, Math Methods Oper Res 63:261-285, 2006), is to construct a sequence of finite games to approximate a (constrained) auxiliary game with an initial distribution that is concentrated on a finite set. However, without hypotheses of bounded costs as in (Alvarez-Mena and Hernández-Lerma, Math Methods Oper Res 63:261-285, 2006), we also establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the auxiliary game with unbounded costs by developing more shaper error bounds of the approximation. The second one, which is new, is to construct a sequence of the auxiliary-type games above and prove that the limit of the sequence of Nash equilibria for the auxiliary-type games is a Nash equilibrium for the original constrained games. Our results are illustrated by a controlled queueing system. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Constrained Nash equilibria; Markov games; Occupation measure; Unbounded costs,,,English,Article in Press

Vendors extend payment dates to encourage sales, and buyers are not required to pay immediately after receiving products. This is equivalent to receiving a price reduction. Besides, buyers reduce their need for capital from bank loans. In addition, a number of defective products are produced during the production process. The number of defective items influences the on-hand inventory levels of buyers, service levels, and frequency of orders. To ensure that the analysis incorporates a realistic production environment, we developed an integrated inventory model with a two-part trade credit and considered an imperfect production process that can be improved by capital investment. The objective was to determine the optimal ordering, shipping, and quality improvement policies to maximize joint total profit. An iterative algorithm was established to determine the optimal strategy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the effects of changing parameter values on the optimal solution. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Capital investment; Imperfect production process; Integrated inventory model; Two-part trade credit,,,English,Article in Press

In this paper, we are committed to apply NIFNs to multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, and meanwhile some new aggregation operators are proposed, including normal intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging operator, normal intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric averaging operator, normal intuitionistic fuzzy-induced ordered weighted averaging operator, normal intuitionistic fuzzy-induced ordered weighted geometric averaging operator and normal intuitionistic fuzzy-induced generalized ordered weighted averaging operator (NIFIGOWA). Based on the NIFIGOWA operator, an approach is introduced to solve MCDM problems where the criteria values are NIFNs and the criteria weight information is fixed. Finally, the proposed method is compared to the existing methods by virtue of a numerical example to verify its feasibility and rationality. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Multi-criteria decision-making; Normal intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operator; Normal intuitionistic fuzzy number; Normal intuitionistic fuzzy-induced generalized aggregation operator,,,English,Article in Press

Each computer in this network has a limited number of communication ports. The described problem is proved to be NP-hard in a general case. Our formulation enables solving the problem by standard ILP solvers like CPLEX or Gurobi. To prove the validity of the proposed ILP formulation, two new reformulations of FTSP are presented.

The general conclusion is that dynamic-interactive graphics for statistics are thriving more than ever as they shift from the desktop to the internet. Thus, dynamic-interactive graphics are becoming increasingly important as they: 1) provide non-experts in statistics with the means to carry out analyses on their own; and 2) teach the basic concepts of statistics to students and practitioners with low to moderate mathematics skills. Their increasing popularity makes the lessons learned over the past 26 years of research on the subject more important than ever. © 2014, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Despite that it has been used widely in this context, it is not very clear in which sense the random variables are being compared. In this paper we provide a characterization which reveals the true nature of this comparison. Given that this comparison is of particular interest when the stochastic order does not hold, we also provide sufficient conditions for the comparisons of the total time on test transforms, when the stochastic order does not hold.

The inversion of the Edgeworth expansion leads to the well known Cornish-Fisher expansion. This paper deals with the inversions of Esscher's, Lugannani-Rice and r* saddlepoint approximations for a class of statistics in the first-order autoregression. Such inversions provide analytically explicit approximations to the quantile, alternative to the Cornish-Fisher expansion. We assess the accuracy of the new approximations both theoretically and numerically and compare them with the normal approximation and the second and third-order Cornish-Fisher expansions. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cornish-Fisher expansion; Edgeworth expansion; First-order autoregression; Saddlepoint approximation,,"Arevalillo, J.M., A second order approximation for the inverse of the distribution function of the sample mean (2001) Kybernetika, 37, pp. 91-102; Arevalillo, J.M., Inverting a saddlepoint approximation (2003) Stat Probab Lett, 61, pp. 421-428; Arevalillo, J.M., Exploring the relation between the r* approximation and the Edgeworth expansion (2012) Metrika, 75, pp. 1009-1024; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Cox, D.R., Edgeworth and saddlepoint approximations with statistical applications (1979) J R Stat Soc B, 41, pp. 279-312; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Cox, D.R., (1989) Asymptotic Techniques for Use in Statistics, , London: Chapman and Hall; Bogdan, M., Asymptotic distributions of linear combinations of order statistics (1994) Appl Math, 22, pp. 201-225; Broda, S., Carstensen, K., Paolella, M.S., Bias-adjusted estimation in the ARX(1) model (2007) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51, pp. 3355-3367; Daniels, H.E., Saddlepoint approximations in statistics (1954) Ann Math Stat, 25, pp. 631-650; Daniels, H.E., The approximate distribution of serial correlation coefficients (1956) Biometrika, 43, pp. 169-185; Daniels, H.E., Tail probability approximations (1987) Int Stat Rev, 55, pp. 37-48; DasGupta, A., (2008) Asymptotic Theory of Statistics and Probability, , Berlin: Springer; Easton, G.S., Ronchetti, E., General saddlepoint approximations with applications to L statistics (1986) J Am Stat Assoc, 81, pp. 420-430; Field, C., Ronchetti, E., (1990) Small sample asymptotics, , IMS lecture notes-monograph series.

If the preference intensity is representable, this uniformity is semimetrizable. A ""uniqueness"" result for preference intensities leads naturally to the hypothesis of compactness.

The estimator is obtained from local fits of the extended Pareto distribution to the relative excesses over a high threshold using an adjusted minimum density power divergence estimation technique. We derive the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator under some mild regularity conditions, and also investigate its finite sample performance with a small simulation experiment. The practical applicability of the methodology is illustrated on a dataset of calcium content measurements of soil samples. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bias-correction; Density power divergence; Local estimation; Pareto-type distribution; Tail index,,"Basu, A., Harris, I.R., Hjort, N.L., Jones, M.C., Robust and efficient estimation by minimizing a density power divergence (1998) Biometrika, 85, pp. 549-559; Beirlant, J., Dierckx, G., Goegebeur, Y., Matthys, G., Tail index estimation and an exponential regression model (1999) Extremes, 2, pp. 177-200; Beirlant, J., Goegebeur, Y., Local polynomial maximum likelihood estimation for Pareto-type distributions (2004) J Multivar Anal, 89, pp. 97-118; Beirlant, J., Goegebeur, Y., Segers, J., Teugels, J., (2004) Statistics of extremes-theory and applications, , Wiley series in probability and statistics.

Calibration of continuous forecasts has been widely discussed, and significance tests are commonly used to detect whether a prediction model is miscalibrated. However, calibration tests for discrete forecasts are rare, especially for distributions with unlimited support. In this paper, we propose two types of calibration tests for count data: tests based on conditional exceedance probabilities and tests based on proper scoring rules. For the latter, three scoring rules are considered: the ranked probability score, the logarithmic score and the Dawid-Sebastiani score. Simulation studies show that all the different tests have good control of the type I error rate and sufficient power under miscalibration. As an illustration, we apply the methodology to weekly data on meningoccocal disease incidence in Germany, 2001–2006. The results show that the test approach is powerful in detecting miscalibrated forecasts. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2014.",Calibration test; Count data; Predictive distribution; Proper scoring rules,,"Brier, G.W., Verification of forecasts expressed in terms of probability (1950) Mon Weather Rev, 78, pp. 1-3; Christoffersen, P.F., Evaluating interval forecasts (1998) Int Econ Rev, 39 (4), pp. 841-862; Corradi, V., Swanson, N.R., Predictive density and conditional confidence interval accuracy tests (2006) J Econ, 135 (1), pp. 187-228; Cox, D.R., Two further applications of a model for binary regression (1958) Biometrika, 45, pp. 562-565; Czado, C., Gneiting, T., Held, L., Predictive model assessment for count data (2009) Biometrics, 65, pp. 1254-1261; Dawid, A.P., Statistical theory: The prequential appoach (1984) J Royal Stat Soc Ser A, 147, pp. 278-292; Dawid, A.P., Sebastiani, P., Coherent dispersion criteria for optimal experimental design (1999) Ann Stat, 27, pp. 65-81; Degroot, M., Schervish, M., (2012) Probability and Statistics, , 4th edn.

This paper is devoted to study the empirical characteristic function process of the residuals. Specifically, it is shown that such process uniformly converges to the population characteristic function (CF) of the innovations in compact sets. The weak convergence of this empirical process, suitably normalized, is also studied.

Here, (Formula Presented.) is to be chosen and fixed. The sample version of this ratio depends only on three order statistics and is the basis for tests and confidence intervals. It is shown that the variance stabilized version of this statistic leads to more powerful tests than the Studentized version of the sample version of (Formula Presented.).

In order to derive computational results for the point availability of the engineering system, we first employ a stochastic process endowed with time-dependent transition measures satisfying coupled partial differential equations. However, an explicit evaluation of the (exact) solution is in general excluded. Therefore, we also propose a numerical solution of the equations. Our methodology is based on new modification of the first-order upwind scheme applied to a semiinfinite region.

Different from the classical vacation policies, the server does not completely stop service but maintains a low service rate in vacation state in case there are customer arrivals. Based on different precision levels of the system information, we discuss the observable queues, the partially observable queues, and the unobservable queues, respectively. For each type of queues, we get both the customers' equilibrium and socially optimal joining-balking strategies and make numerical comparisons between them. We numerically observe that their equilibrium strategy is unique, and especially, the customers' equilibrium joining probability in vacation state is not necessarily smaller than that in busy state in the partially observable queues. Moreover, we also find that the customers' individual behavior always deviates from the social expectation and makes the system more congested. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Balking strategy; Customer behavior; Information precision; Markovian queues; Multiple working vacations,,"Adan, I., Economou, A., Kapodistria, S., Synchronized reneging in queueing systems with vacations (2009) Queueing Syst, 62 (1), pp. 1-33; Burnetas, A., Economou, A., Equilibrium customer strategies in a single server Markovian queue with setup times (2007) Queueing Syst, 56 (3-4), pp. 213-228; Dimitrakopoulos, Y., Burnetas, A., (2011) Customer equilibrium and optimal strategies in an M/M/1 queue with dynamic service control, , Working paper, University of Athens; Economou, A., Kanta, S., Equilibrium balking strategies in the observable single-server queue with breakdowns and repairs (2008) Oper Res Lett, 36 (6), pp. 696-699; Economou, A., Gómez-Corral, A., Kanta, S., Optimal balking strategies in single-server queues with general service and vacation times (2011) Perform Eval, 68 (10), pp. 967-982; Guo, P., Hassin, R., Strategic behavior and social optimization in Markovian vacation queues (2011) Oper Res, 59 (4), pp. 986-997; Guo, P., Hassin, R., Strategic behavior and social optimization in Markovian vacation queues: the case of heterogeneous customers (2012) Eur J Oper Res, 222 (2), pp. 278-286; Jagannathan, K., Menache, I., Modiano, E., Zussman, G., Non-cooperative spectrum access-the dedicated vs. free spectrum choice (2011) MobiHoc'11, , Paris, FranceMay 16-20, 2011; Latouche, G., Ramaswami, V., (1999) Introduction to Matrix Analysis Methods in Stochastic Modeling, , ASA-SIAM series on applied probability, Philadelphia: SIAM; Liu, W., Xu, X., Tian, N., Stochastic decompositions in the M/M/1 queue with working vacations (2007) Oper Res Lett, 35 (5), pp. 595-600; Neuts, M., (1981) Matrix-Geometric Solutions in Stochastic Models, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; Sun, W., Guo, P., Tian, N., Equilibrium threshold strategies in observable queueing systems with setup/closedown times (2010) Cent Eur J Oper Res, 18 (3), pp. 241-268; Sun, W., Wang, Y., Tian, N., Pricing and setup/closedown policies in unobservable queues with strategic customers (2012) 4or, 10 (3), pp. 287-311; Takagi, H., (1991) Queueing Analysis-a Foundation of Performance Evaluation, 1. , Vacation and priority systems, Amsterdam: North-Holland; Tian, N., Zhang, Z.G., (2006) Vacation Queueing Models: Theory and Applications, , New York: Springer; Tian, N., Li, J., Zhang, Z.G., Matrix analysis method and working vacation queues-a survey (2009) Int J Inf Manag Sci, 20 (4), pp. 603-633",English,Article

A solution of the blending problem minimizes a linear cost objective and an integer valued objective that keeps track of the number of raw materials that are used by the two recipes, i.e. this is a bi-objective problem. Additionally, the solution must be robust. We focus on possible solution approaches that provide a guarantee to solve bi-blending problems with a certain accuracy, where two products are using (partly) the same scarce raw materials. The bi-blending problem is described, and a search strategy based on Branch-and-Bound is analysed. Specific tests are developed for the bi-blending aspect of the problem.

We provide theoretical results, proving new formulae for their calculation and shedding light on the relationship between these factors and important statistical properties of S-estimators. We also give computational advances, suggesting efficient procedures so that hardly any time is lost for their calculation when computing S-estimates. In addition, when the purpose is to fix the efficiency of the scale estimator, we are able to quantify to what extent the approximate algorithms which are currently available provide an acceptable solution, and when it is necessary to resort to the exact formulae. Finally, even if this paper concentrates on S-estimates and Tukey's Biweight and optimal loss functions, the main results can be easily extended to calculate the tuning consistency factors for other popular loss function and other robust estimators. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic variance; Biweight function; Breakdown point; Elliptical truncation; Mahalanobis distance; Robust regression,,"Atkinson, A.C., Riani, M., (2000) Robust Diagnostic Regression Analysis, , New-York: Springer; Boudt, K., Croux, C., Robust M-estimation of multivariate GARCH models (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 2459-2469; Campbell, N.A., Mixture models and atypical values (1984) Math Geol, 16, pp. 465-477; Cerioli, A., Multivariate outlier detection with high-breakdown estimators (2010) J Am Stat Assoc, 105, pp. 147-156; Cizek, P., Reweighted least trimmed squares: an alternative to one-step estimators (2013) Test, 22, pp. 514-533; Croux, C., Haesbroeck, G., Influence function and efficiency of the minimum covariance determinant scatter matrix estimator (1999) J Multivar Anal, 71, pp. 161-190; Croux, C., Dhaene, G., Hoorelbeke, D., Testing the information matrix equality with robust estimators (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 3583-3613; Croux, C., Dehon, C., Yadine, A., On the optimality of multivariate S-estimators (2011) Scand J Stat, 38, pp. 332-341; Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Matrán, C., Mayo-Iscar, A., Trimming and likelihood: robust location and dispersion estimation in the elliptical model (2008) Ann Stat, 36, pp. 2284-2318; Davies, P.L., Asymptotic behaviour of S-estimates of multivariate location parameters and disperion matrices (1987) Ann Stat, 15, pp. 1269-1292; Davies, P.L., The asymptotics of S-estimators in the linear regression model (1990) Ann Stat, 18, pp. 1651-1675; Dehon, C., Gassner, M., Verardi, V., Extending the Hausman test to check for the presence of outliers (2012) Adv Econom Essays Honor Jerry Hausman, 29, pp. 435-453; Garcìa-Escudero, L.A., Gordaliza, A., Generalized radius processes for elliptically contoured distributions (2005) J Am Stat Assoc, 100, pp. 1036-1045; García-Escudero, L.A., Gordaliza, A., Matrán, C., Mayo-Iscar, A., A general trimming approach to robust cluster analysis (2008) Ann Stat, 36, pp. 1324-1345; Holmquist, B., Moments and cumulants of the multivariate normal distribution (1988) Stoch Anal Appl, 6, pp. 273-278; Hössjer, O., On the optimality of S-estimators (1992) Stat Probab Lett, 14, pp. 413-419; Hubert, M., Rousseeuw, P.J., van Aelst, S., High-breakdown robust multivariate methods (2008) Stat Sci, 23, pp. 92-119; Hubert, M., Rousseeuw, P.J., Verdonck, T., A deterministic algorithm for robust location and scatter (2012) J Comput Graph Stat, 21, pp. 618-637; Isserlis, L., On a formula for the product-moment coefficient of any order of a normal frequency distribution in any number of variables (1918) Biometrika, 12, pp. 34-39; Kent, J.T., Tyler, D.E., Redescending M-estimates of multivariate location and scatter (1991) Ann Stat, 19, pp. 2102-2119; Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N., Johnson, N.L., (2000) Continuous Multivariate Distributions, 1. , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Liu, R.Y., Parelius, J.M., Singh, K., Multivariate analysis by data depth: descriptive statistics, graphics and inference (1999) Ann Stat, 27, pp. 783-840; Lopuhaä, H.P., On the relation between S-estimators and M-estimators of multivariate location and covariance (1989) Ann Stat, 17, pp. 1662-1683; Maronna, R.A., Martin, R.D., Yohai, V.J., (2006) Robust Statistics, , New York: Wiley; Paindaveine, D., Elliptical symmetry (2012) Encyclopedia of Environmetrics, pp. 802-807. , 2nd edn., A.

The problem is among the classical NP-hard optimization problems and there has been extensive research on exact and approximative algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new model based on binary variables dijk that are equal to 1 if nodes i and j have distance k in the ordering.

Among many learning models, the support vector machine is a popular model with high classification ability which can be trained by mathematical programming methods. Since the model was originally formulated for binary classification, various kinds of extensions have been investigated formulti-class classification. In this paper, we review some existing models, and introduce new models which we recently proposed. The models are derived from the viewpoint of multi-objective maximization of geometric margins for a discriminant function, and each model can be trained by solving a second-order cone programming problem. We show that discriminant functions with high generalization ability can be obtained by these models through some numerical experiments. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2014.",Machine learning; Multi-class classification; Multiobjective optimization; Second-order cone programming problem; Support vector machine,,"Abe, S., (2010) Support Vector Machines for Pattern Classification, , Springer, New York; Abe, S., Inoue, T., (2002) Fuzzy Support Vector Machines for Multiclass Problem, pp. 113-118. , In: Proceedings ofEuropean symposium on artificial neural network; Andersen, E.D., Roos, C., Terlaky, T., On implementing a primal-dual interior-point method for conic quadratic optimization (2003) Math Program Ser B, 95, pp. 249-277; Alizadeh, F., Goldfarb, D., Second-order cone programmin (2003) Math Program Ser, 95, pp. 3-51; Allwein, E.L., Schapire, R.E., Singer, Y., Reducing multiclass to binary: A unifying approach for margin classifier (2000) J Mach Learn Re, 1, pp. 113-141; Bottou, L., Cortes, C., Denker, J., Drucker, H., Guyon, I., Jackel, L., Lecun, Y., Vapnik, S.P., V, (1994) Comparison of Classifier Methods: A Case Study in Handwriting Digit Recognition, pp. 77-87. , In: Proceedings of international conference on pattern recognition; Bredensteiner, E.J., Bennett, K.P., Multicategory classification by support vector machines (1999) Comput Optim Appl, 12, pp. 53-79; Chang, C.C., Lin, C.-J., (2001), http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/libsvm, LIBSVM: a library for support vector machinesCrammer, K., Singer, Y., (2002), 47, pp. 201-233. , On the learnability and design of output codes for multiclass problems.

In this model the information that flows through a link between two players runs only towards the player that initiates and supports the link, so in order for it to flow in both directions, both players must pay whatever the unit cost of a directional link is. We assume that an exogenous ""societal cover"" consisting of a collection of possibly overlapping subsets covering the set of players specifies the social organization in different groups or ""societies,"" so that a player may initiate links only with players that belong to at least one society that he/she also belongs to, thus restricting the feasible strategies and networks. In this setting, we examine the impact of such societal constraints on stable/efficient architectures and on dynamics. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Dynamics; Network formation; One-way flow model; Stability,,"Bala, V., Goyal, S., A noncooperative model of network formation (2000) Econometrica, 68, pp. 1181-1229; Billand, P., Bravard, C., Sarangi, S., Existence of Nash networks in one-way flow models (2008) Econ Theory, 37, pp. 491-507; Derks, J., Tennekes, M., A note on the existence of Nash networks in one-way flow models (2009) Econ Theory, 41, pp. 515-522; Derks, J., Kuipers, J., Tennekes, M., Thuijsman, F., Existence of Nash networks in the one-way flow model of network formation (2009) Modeling, Computation and Optimization, , S.

To capture strategic interactions in service supply chain, we study a case where there are two service vendors providing competing service products and selling them through a common Service Integrator. In particular, we derive and compare equilibrium solutions (e.g. service prices, wholesale prices, service volumes) for the service supply chain under three different scenarios. We then study the effect of key parameters in the model upon the equilibrium solution using sensitivity analysis, and discuss our results along with a numerical experiment. Finally, future research direction is pointed out. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Competition; Service integrator; Service supply chain; Service vendor; Strategic interaction,,"Allon, G., Federgruen, A., Competition in service industries with segmented markets (2009) Manag Sci, 55 (4), pp. 619-634; Apte, U.M., Nath, H.K., Size, structure and growth of the US information economy (2007) Manag Inf Econ, 1 (1), pp. 1-28; Apte, U., Ferrer, G., Lewis, I., Rendon, R., (2008) Service supply chain in the department of defense: Opportunities and challenges, pp. 235-242. , Springer US; Chao, X., Liu, L., Zheng, S., Resource allocation in multisite service systems with interstice customer flows (2003) Manag Sci, 49 (12), pp. 1739-1752; Chase, R.B., Kumar, K.R., Youngdahl, W.E., Service-based manufacturing: the service factory (1992) Prod Oper Manag, 1 (2), pp. 175-184; Chayakrit, C., (2004) Competition in supply chain with service contributions, , PhD thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, Charoensiriwath, Chayakrit; Chen, I.J., Paulraj, A., Understanding supply chain management: critical research and a theoretical framework (2004) Int J Prod Res, 42 (1), pp. 131-163; Chiang, W.K., Chhajed, D., Hess, J.D., Direct marketing, indirect profits: a strategic analysis of dual-channel supply chain design (2003) Manag Sci, 49 (1), pp. 1-20; Cho, R.K., Gerchak, Y., Supply chain coordination with downstream operating costs: coordination and investment to improve downstream operating efficiency (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 162 (3), pp. 762-772; Choi, S.C., Price competition in a duopoly common retailer channel (1996) J Retail, 72 (2), pp. 117-134; Dernirkan, H., Cheng, H.K., The risk and information sharing of application services supply chain (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 187 (3), pp. 765-784; Du, T.C., Lee, H., Chen, A., Constructing federated databases in coordinated supply chains (2003) Decis Support Syst, 36 (1), pp. 49-64; Ellram, L.M., Tate, W.L., Billington, C., Understanding and managing the service supply chain (2004) The Journal of Supply Chain Management, pp. 17-32; Hua, G., Wang, S., Cheng, T.C.E., Price and lead time decisions in dual-channel supply chains (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 205, pp. 113-126; Huang, W., Swaminathan, J.M., Introduction of a second channel: implications for pricing and profits (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 194 (1), pp. 258-279; Khouja, M., Rajagopalan, H.K., Sharer, E., Coordination and incentives in a supplier-retailer rental information goods supply chain (2010) Int J Prod Econ, 123 (2), pp. 279-289; Kurata, H., Yao, D.Q., Liu, J.J., Price policies under direct vs indirect channel competition and national vs store brand competition (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 180, pp. 262-281; Lusch, R.F., Vargo, S.L., O'Brien, M.S., Competing through service: insights from service-dominant logic (2007) J Retail, 83 (1), pp. 5-18; McGuire, T.M., Staelin, R., An industry equilibrium analysis of downstream vertical integration (1983) Mark Sci, 2 (2), pp. 161-191; Neu, W., Brown, S., Manufactures marketing services: factors underlying the changing business domain (2000) American Marketing Association Conference Proceedings, pp. 189-191. , Chicago, USA; Peng, L., Tong, Z., Li, Q., An analysis of the third party payment system based on service supply chain (2009) IEEE IRI 2009, , Las Vegas, Nevada, USA; Qiu, R.G., Computational thinking of service systems: dynamics and adaptiveness modeling (2009) Serv Sci, 1 (1), pp. 42-55; Raju, J., Abhik, R., Market information and firm performance (2000) Manag Sci, 46 (8), pp. 1075-1084; Richey, R.G., Dalela Jr., M.T.V., Examining collaborative supply chain service technologies: a study of intensity, relationships, and resources (2010) J Acad Mark Sci, 38, pp. 71-89; Roth, A.V., Menor, L.J., Insights into service operations management: a research agenda (2003) Prod Oper Manag, 12 (2), pp. 145-164; Spohrer, J., Maglio, P.P., The emergence of service science: toward systematic service innovations to accelerate co-creation of value (2008) Prod Oper Manag, 17 (3), pp. 1-9; Tirole, J., (2000) The Theory of Industrial Organization, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Tsay, A.A., Agrawal, N., Channel dynamics under price and service competition (2000) Manuf Serv Oper Manag, 2 (4), pp. 372-391; Vargo, S.L., Lusch, R.F., Evolving to a new dominant logic for marketing (2004) J Mark, 68, pp. 1-17; Voss, C., Applying service concepts in manufacturing (1992) Int J Oper Prod Manag, 12 (4), pp. 93-99; Yao, D.Q., Yue, X.H., Liu, J., Vertical cost information sharing in a supply chain with value-adding retailers (2008) Omega, 36 (5), pp. 838-851; Youngdahl, W.E., An investigation of service-based manufacturing performance relationships (1996) Int J Oper Prod Manag, 16 (8), pp. 29-43; Yue, X., Liu, J.J., Demand forecast sharing in a dual-channel supply chain (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 174, pp. 646-667",English,Article

In particular, it has a great influence on passenger satisfaction with the whole transit network system. The present research proposes a simulated annealing (SA) method for optimizing a transit network design. In the algorithm, the strategy to search for neighborhood solutions provides the chance to find the best hybrid of line-type and circular-type routes. The proposed SA method is also compared with other methods. The results show that the proposed SA model is a good alternative for transit network design, particularly as it provides the scope to design hybrids of line-type and circular-type routes. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Circular-type route; Line-type route; Simulated annealing; Transit network,,"Agrawal, J., Mathew, T.V., Transit route network design using parallel genetic algorithm (2004) J Comput Civ Eng, 18 (3), pp. 248-256; Amorim, P., Parragh, S.N., Sperandio, F., Almada-Lobo, B., A rich vehicle routing problem dealing with perishable food: a case study (2012) Top, , doi:10.1007/s11750-012-0266-4; Baaj, M.H., Mahmassani, H.S., An AI-based approach for transit route system planning and design (1991) J Adv Transp, 25 (2), pp. 187-210; Borndörfer, R., Grötschel, M., Pfetsch, M.E., A column-generation approach to line planning in public transport (2007) Transp Sci, 41 (1), pp. 123-132; Ceder, A., Wilson, N.H.M., Bus network design (1986) Transp Res, Part B, Methodol, 20 (4), pp. 331-344; Chakroborty, P., Dwivedi, T., Optimal route network design for transit systems using genetic algorithms (2002) Eng Optim, 34 (1), pp. 83-100; Fan, W., Machemehl, R.B., Using a simulated annealing algorithm to solve the transit route network design problem (2006) J Transp Eng, 132 (2), pp. 122-132; Fan, W., Machemehl, R.B., Optimal transit route network design problem with variable transit demand: genetic algorithm approach (2006) J Transp Eng, 132 (1), pp. 40-51; Fan, L., Mumford, C.L., A metaheuristic approach to the urban transit routing problem (2010) J Heuristics, 16, pp. 353-372; Floyd, R.D., Algorithm 97: shortest path (1962) Commun ACM, 5 (6), p. 345; Guihaire, V., Hao, J.K., Transit network timetabling and vehicle assignment for regulating authorities (2010) Comput Ind Eng, 59, pp. 16-23; Hajek, B., Cooling schedules for optimal annealing (1988) Math Oper Res, 13, pp. 311-329; Johnson, D.S., Aragon, C.R., McGeoch, L.A., Schevon, C., Optimization by simulated annealing: an experimental evaluation: Part I, graph partitioning (1989) Oper Res, 37, pp. 865-892; Kidwai, F.A., (1998) Optimal design of bus transit network: A genetic algorithm based approach, , PhD Dissertation, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India; Kirkpatrick, S., Gelatt Jr., C.D., Vecchi, M.P., Optimization by simulated annealing (1983) Science, 220, pp. 671-680; Lam, S.W., Tang, L.C., Goh, T.N., Halim, T., Multiresponse optimization of dispatch rules for public bus service (2009) Comput Ind Eng, 56, pp. 77-86; Lee, D.H., Cao, Z., Meng, Q., Scheduling of two-transtainer systems for loading outbound containers in port container terminals with simulated annealing algorithm (2007) Int J Prod Econ, 107, pp. 115-124; Lundy, M., Mees, A., Convergence of an annealing algorithm (1986) Math Program, 34, pp. 111-124; Mandl, C.E., Evaluation and optimization of urban public transportation networks (1979) The Third European Congress on Operational Research, , Amsterdam, Netherlands; Marín, Á., An extension to rapid transit network design problem (2007) Top, 15 (2), pp. 231-241; Newel, C.E., Some issues related to the optimal design of bus routes (1979) Transp Sci, 13 (1), pp. 20-35; Pattnaik, S.B., Mohan, S., Tom, V.M., Urban bus transit route network design using genetic algorithm (1998) J Transp Eng, 124 (4), pp. 368-375; Yang, T., Kuo, Y., Chang, I., Tabu-search simulation optimization approach for flow-shop scheduling with multiple processors-a case study (2004) Int J Prod Res, 42, pp. 4015-4030; Yang, T., Peters, B.A., Tu, M., Layout design for flexible manufacturing systems considering single-loop directional flow patterns (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 164, pp. 440-455; Zhao, F., Gan, A., (2003) Optimization of transit network to minimize transfers, , Final Report, Lehman Center for Transportation Research, Florida International University; Zhao, F., Zeng, X., Simulated annealing-genetic algorithm for transit network optimization (2006) J Comput Civ Eng, 20 (1), pp. 57-68; Zhao, F., Zeng, X., Optimization for transit network layout and headway with a combined genetic algorithm and simulated annealing method (2006) Eng Optim, 38 (6), pp. 701-722; Zhao, F., Zeng, X., Optimization of transit route network, vehicle headways and timetables for large-scale transit networks (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 186, pp. 841-855",English,Article

Based on spline smoothing, we propose data-driven simultaneous confidence corridors for the coefficient functions with asymptotically correct confidence level. Such confidence corridors are useful benchmarks for statistical inference on the global shapes of coefficient functions under any hypotheses. Simulation experiments corroborate with the theoretical results.

The backlogged demand ratio is given by a nonincreasing function of the quantity of shortage. Some general properties for the expected cost are derived under weak assumptions about the backorder rate function. When the backorder rate is a linear function, some sufficient conditions for the global convexity of the expected cost are derived. A sufficient condition for the local concavity of this function is also provided.

Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to the parameters of the backorder rate function is included.

In this paper, taking inspiration from what has already been done, in view of the efficiency of the generating functions method, we define a generating function for computing the Public Good index, maintaining the property of exactness of the resulting algorithm. The main difference with the existing algorithms derives from the fact that the Public Good index takes into account only minimal winning coalitions and counts how many swings of a player involve them. Moreover, we study the computational complexity of the algorithm and we evaluate the Public Good index for the vote share of the Russian Duma in 1995. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Generating functions; Minimal winning coalitions; Public Good index,,"Algaba, E., Bilbao, J.M., Fernández García, J.R., López, J.J., Computing power indices in weighted multiple majority games (2003) Math Soc Sci, 46, pp. 63-80; Algaba, E., Bilbao, J.M., Fernández, J.R., The distribution of power in the European Constitution (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 176, pp. 1752-1766; Alonso-Meijide, J.M., (2002) Contributiones a la teoría del valor en juegos cooperativos con condicionamientos exógenos, , PhD thesis, Santiago de Compostela University; Alonso-Meijide, J.M., Bowles, C., Generating functions for coalitional power indices: an application to the IMF (2005) Ann Oper Res, 137, pp. 21-44; Alonso-Meijide, J.M., Bilbao, J.M., Casas-Méndez, B., Fernández García, J.R., Weighted multiple majority games with unions: generating functions and applications to the European Union (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 198, pp. 530-544; Alonso-Meijide, J.M., Casas-Méndez, B., Fiestras-Janeiro, M.G., Holler, M.J., Two variations of the Public Good Index for games with a priori unions (2010) Control Cybern, 39, pp. 839-855; Banzhaf, J.F., Weighted voting doesn't work: a mathematical analysis (1965) Rutgers Law Rev, 19, pp. 317-343; Barry, B., Is it better to be powerful or lucky?

We illustrate the general version of the LM model which includes individual covariates, and several constrained versions. Constraints make the model more parsimonious and allow us to consider and test hypotheses of interest. These constraints may be put on the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent process (measurement model) or on the distribution of the latent process (latent model). We also illustrate in detail maximum likelihood estimation through the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which may be efficiently implemented by recursions taken from the hidden Markov literature. We outline methods for obtaining standard errors for the parameter estimates. We also illustrate methods for selecting the number of states and for path prediction. Finally, we mention issues related to Bayesian inference of LM models.

(Ann Stat 39:613-642, 2011) for detecting the presence of spatial signals for large-scale 2D and 3D imaging data. In contrast to the conventional multiple testing procedure, the FDRL procedure substitutes each p-value by a locally aggregated median filter of p-values. This paper examines the performance of another commonly used filter, mean filter, in the FDRL procedure. It is demonstrated that when the p-values are independent and uniformly distributed under the true null hypotheses, (i) in view of estimating the resulting false discovery rate, the mean filter better alleviates the ""lack of identification phenomenon"" of the FDRL procedure than the median filter; (ii) in view of signal detection, the median filter enjoys the ""edge-preserving property"" and lends support to its better performance in detecting sparse signals than the mean filter. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Brain fMRI; False discovery rate; Median; p-value; Sensitivity; Specificity,,"Arias-Castro, E., Donoho, D.L., Does median filtering truly preserve edges better than linear filtering?

Recently, the least absolute relative error (LARE) estimation was proposed to be a useful alternative to the conventional least squares (LS) or least absolute deviation (LAD). However, one may resort to the time-consuming resampling methods for the inference of the LARE estimation. This paper proposes an empirical likelihood approach towards constructing confidence intervals/regions of the regression parameters for the multiplicative models. The major advantage of the proposal is its ability of internal studentizing to avoid density estimation. And it is computationally fast. Simulation studies investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. An analysis of the body fat data is presented to illustrate the new method. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Empirical likelihood; Multiplicative regression model; Relative error estimation,,"Chan, N.H., Peng, L., Qi, Y., Quantile inference for near-integrated autoregressive time series with infinite variance (2006) Stat Sin, 16, pp. 15-28; Chen, S.X., van Keilegom, I., A review on empirical likelihood methods for regression (2009) Test, 18, pp. 415-447; Chen, K., Ying, Z., Zhang, H., Zhao, L.C., Analysis of least absolute deviation (2008) Biometrika, 95, pp. 107-122; Chen, K., Guo, S., Lin, Y., Ying, Z., Least absolute relative error estimation (2010) J Am Stat Assoc, 105, pp. 1104-1112; Freedman, D.A., Peters, S.C., Bootstrapping a regression equation: some empirical results (1984) J Am Stat Assoc, 79, pp. 97-106; Jin, Z., Lin, D.Y., Wei, L.J., Ying, Z., Rank-based inference for the accelerated failure time model (2003) Biometrika, 90, pp. 341-353; Khoshgoftaar, T.M., Bhattacharyya, B.B., Richardson, G.D., Predicting software errors, during development, using nonlinear regression models: a comparative study (1992) IEEE Trans Reliab, 41, pp. 390-395; Li, J., Liang, W., He, S., Empirical likelihood for AR-ARCH models based on LAD estimation (2012) Acta Math Appl Sin, 28, pp. 371-382; Makridakis, S., Andersen, A., Carbone, R., Fildes, R., Hibon, M., Lewandowski, R., Newton, J., Winkler, R., (1984) The Forecasting Accuracy of Major Time Series Methods, , New York: Wiley; Narula, S.C., Wellington, J.F., Prediction, linear regression and the minimum sum of relative errors (1977) Technometrics, 19, pp. 185-190; Owen, A., Empirical likelihood ratio confidence intervals for a single functional (1988) Biometrika, 75, pp. 237-249; Owen, A., Empirical likelihood ratio confidence regions (1990) Ann Stat, 18, pp. 90-120; Owen, A., (2001) Empirical Likelihood, , London: Chapman & Hall; Park, H., Stefanski, L.A., Relative-error prediction (1998) Stat Probab Lett, 40, pp. 227-236; Penrose, K.W., Nelson, A.G., Fisher, A.G., Generalized body composition prediction equation for men using simple measurement techniques (abstract) (1985) Med Sci Sports Exerc, 17, p. 189; Qin, J., Lawless, J.F., Empirical likelihood and general estimating equations (1994) Ann Stat, 22, pp. 300-325; Rao, C.R., (1973) Linear Statistical Inference and Its Applications, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Rao, C.R., Zhao, L.C., Approximation to the distribution of M-estimates in linear models by randomly weighted bootstrap (1992) Sankhya A, 54, pp. 323-331; Teekens, R., Koerts, J., Some statistical implications of the log transformation of multiplicative models (1972) Econometrica, 40, pp. 793-819; Ye, J., (2007) Price models and the value relevance of accounting information, , Technical report, Baruch college-Stan Ross Dept. of Accountancy, City University of New York",English,Article

We assume that clients are identified with their location on the Euclidean plane, and facilities can be opened anywhere in the plane. The leader opens p facilities. Later on, the follower opens r facilities. Each client patronizes the closest facility. In case of ties, the leader's facility is preferred. The goal is to find p facilities for the leader to maximize his market share. We show that this Stackelberg game is Σ2 P-hard. Moreover, we strengthen the previous results for the discrete case and networks.

Nevertheless, the use of these techniques has some limitations, namely when the number of decision variables with interval coefficients is high since the number of objective functions at stake in the sub-problem for testing the (weak) efficiency of each non-basic variable may be easily out of an acceptable computational effort. A similar problem may arise with the number of sub-problems for testing the multi-parametric optimality of each solution obtained (that is, to check whether the solution is possibly optimal or not) and the multi-parametric optimality of each edge by using the all emanating edges algorithm. An alternative algorithm is suggested that allows obtaining all possibly optimal solutions, which fulfill the formal criteria of optimality in a feasible bounded region. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Interval linear programming; Optimizing approach; Possibly optimal solutions,,"Bazaraa, M.S., Jarvis, J.J., Sheralli, H.D., (1990) Linear Programming and Network Flows, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Ida, M., Necessary efficient test in interval multiobjective linear programming (1999) Proceedings of the Eighth International Fuzzy Systems Association World Congress, pp. 500-504; Inuiguchi, M., Higashitani, H., Tanino, T., (1999) On Enumeration of Possibly Optimal Extreme Points in Linear Programming Problems with Interactive Possibilistic Variables, , Aachen, GermanyProceedings of 7th European congress on intelligent techniques and soft computingCD Rom, CC5-312852_P.pdf; Inuiguchi, M., Sakawa, M., Possible and necessary optimality tests in possibilistic linear programming problems (1994) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 67, pp. 29-46; Inuiguchi, M., Sakawa, M., Minimax regret solution to linear programming problems with an interval objective function (1995) Eur J Oper Res, 86, pp. 526-536; Inuiguchi, M., Sakawa, M., Possible and necessary efficiency in possibilistic multiobjective linear programming problems and possible efficiency test (1996) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 78, pp. 231-241; Oliveira, C., Antunes, C.H., Multiple objective linear programming models with interval coefficients - an illustrated overview (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 181 (3), pp. 1434-1463; Oliveira, C., Antunes, C.H., An interactive method of tackling uncertainty in interval multiple objective linear programming (2009) J Math Sci, 161 (6), pp. 854-866; Steuer, R.E., Vector-maximum gradient cone contraction techniques (1978) Multiple Criteria Problem Solving, 155, pp. 462-481. , Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems, Berlin: Springer; Steuer, R.E., Algorithms for linear programming problems with interval objective function coefficients (1981) Math Oper Res, 6 (3), pp. 333-348; Steuer, R.E., (1986) Multiple Criteria Optimization: Theory, Computation and Application, , New York: Wiley",English,Article

In fact, computing the so-called ""incenter"" of a solid closed convex cone is a matter of solving a nonsmooth convex optimization program.

KFSD is a local-oriented and kernel-based version of the recently proposed functional spatial depth (FSD) that may be useful for studying functional samples that require an analysis at a local level. In addition, we consider supervised functional classification problems, focusing on cases in which the differences between groups are not extremely clear-cut or the data may contain outlying curves. We perform classification by means of some available robust methods that involve the use of a given functional depth, including FSD and KFSD, among others. We use the functional k-nearest neighbor classifier as a benchmark procedure. The results of a simulation study indicate that the KFSD-based classification approach leads to good results. Finally, we consider two real classification problems, obtaining results that are consistent with the findings observed with simulated curves. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Functional depths; Functional outliers; Functional spatial depth; Kernelized functional spatial depth; Supervised functional classification,,"Agostinelli, C., Romanazzi, M., Local depth (2011) J Stat Plan Inference, 141, pp. 817-830; Biau, G., Bunea, F., Wegkamp, M., Functional classification in hilbert spaces (2005) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 51, pp. 2163-2172; Brown, B.M., Statistical uses of the spatial median (1983) J R Stat Soc Ser B, 45, pp. 25-30; Burba, F., Ferraty, F., Vieu, P., K-nearest neighbour method in functional nonparametric regression (2009) J Nonparametr Stat, 21, pp. 453-469; Cardot, H., Cénac, P., Zitt, P.A., Efficient and fast estimation of the geometric median in hilbert spaces with an averaged stochastic gradient algorithm (2013) Bernoulli, 19, pp. 18-43; Cérou, F., Guyader, A., Nearest neighbor classification in infinite dimension (2006) ESAIM Probab Stat, 10, pp. 340-355; Chakraborty, A., Chaudhuri, P., On data depth in infinite dimensional spaces (2014) Ann Inst Stat Math, 66, pp. 303-324; Chaudhuri, P., On a geometric notion of quantiles for multivariate data (1996) J Am Stat Assoc, 91, pp. 862-872; Chen, Y., Dang, X., Peng, H., Bart, H.L., Outlier detection with the kernelized spatial depth function (2009) IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell, 31, pp. 288-305; Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Nieto-Reyes, A., The random tukey depth (2008) Comput Stat Data Anal, 52, pp. 4979-4988; Cuevas, A., Fraiman, R., On depth measures and dual statistics.

This study developed a simulation model to evaluate the performance of various investigation-triggering mechanisms in various scenarios of aircraft fleet reliability. Factors that affect performance include flight delay costs, investigation costs, the costs of corrective actions, the accuracy of investigations, the effectiveness of corrective actions, and the monthly improvement rate. Nine investigation- triggering mechanisms were evaluated. The simulation results show that the monthly improvement rate significantly influences performance. The subject airline’s original investigation-triggering mechanism is not outstanding in most scenarios. This study recommends two of the nine investigation-triggering mechanisms for airlines when they select investigation-triggering mechanisms in various scenarios. Thus, useful guidance for adjusting airlines’ investigation-triggering mechanisms can be effectively provided. © Sociedad de Estadìstica e Investigaciòn Operativa 2013.",Aircraft maintenance; Modeling; Reliability control program; Simulation; Upper control limit,,"Berenson, M.L., Levine, D.M., Krehbiel, T.C., (2002) Basic Business Statistics, , Prentice-Hall International Inc, New Jersey; (1978) Maintenance Control by Reliability Methods, , advisory circular AC 120-17A; (1997) Aircraft Maintenance Management, p. 57. , U.S. Department of Transportation Friend CF, Addison Wesley Longman Limited, England; Hillier, F.S., Lieberman, G.J., (2010) Introduction to Operations Research, International Edn, pp. 1084-1175. , McGraw-Hill Companies Inc, New York; Operation of aircraft part I international commercial air transport—Aeroplanes, 11.3 Maintenance programme (2001) Annex 6 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, , 8th edn; Kinnison, H.A., (2004) Aviation Maintenance Management, p. 206. , McGraw-Hill Companies Inc, New York; Lovell, C., Pastor, J.T., The contribution of operations research techniques to the evaluation of electric utility performance (1994) TOP, 2 (1), pp. 167-173; Moretti, S., Patrone, F., Transversality of the Shapley value (2008) TOP, 16, pp. 1-41; O ¨, R.T., Artificial intelligence in simulation (1994) Ann Oper Res, 53, pp. 287-319; Safaei, N., Banjevic, D., Jardine, A., Workforce-constrained maintenance scheduling for military aircraft fleet: A case study (2011) Ann Oper Res, 186, pp. 295-316; Ubeda, J.R., Allan, R.N., Stochastic simulation and Monte Carlo methods applied to the assessment of hydro-thermal generating system operation (1994) TOP, 2 (1), pp. 1-24; Wu, C.-L., Caves, R.E., Aircraft operational costs and turnaround efficiency at airports (2000) J Air Transpl Manag, 6 (4), pp. 201-208",English,Article

In the first part, we review and study the properties of single-stage cross-sectional and time series benchmarking procedures that have been proposed in the literature in the context of small area estimation. We compare cross-sectional and time series benchmarking empirically, using data generated from a time series model which complies with the familiar Fay–Herriot model at any given time point. In the second part, we review cross-sectional methods proposed for benchmarking hierarchical small areas and develop a new two-stage benchmarking procedure for hierarchical time series models. The latter procedure is applied to monthly unemployment estimates in Census Divisions and States of the USA. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Autocorrelated sampling errors; Generalized least squares; Internal benchmarking; Optimality; Recursive filtering; State-space models; Trend and seasonal effects,,"Battese, G.E., Harter, R.M., Fuller, W.A., An error components model for prediction of county crop area using survey and satellite data (1988) J Am Stat Assoc, 83, pp. 28-36; Bell, W.R., Datta, G.S., Ghosh, M., Benchmarking small area estimators (2012) Biometrika, 100, pp. 189-202; Butar, F., Lahiri, P., On measures of uncertainty of empirical Bayes small area estimators (2003) J Stat Plan Inference, 112, pp. 63-76; Cholette, P., Dagum, E.B., Benchmarking time series with autocorrelated survey errors (1994) Int Stat Rev, 62, pp. 365-377; Dagum, E.B., Cholette, P., (2006) Benchmarking, temporal distribution and reconciliation methods for time series data, , Springer, New York:; Datta, G.S., Ghosh, M., Steorts, R., Maples, J., Bayesian benchmarking with applications to small area estimation (2011) Test, 20, pp. 574-588; Di Fonso, T., Marini, R., Simultaneous and two-step reconciliation of systems of time series: methodological and practical issues (2011) J R Stat Soc Ser C, 60, pp. 143-164; Doran, H.E., Constraining Kalman filter and smoothing estimates to satisfy time-varying restrictions (1992) Rev Econ Stat, 74, pp. 568-572; Durbin, J., Quenneville, B., Benchmarking by state space models (1997) Int Stat Rev, 65, pp. 23-48; Fay, R.E., Herriot, R.A., Estimates of income for small places: an application of James–Stein procedures to census data (1979) J Am Stat Assoc, 74, pp. 269-277; Ghosh, M., Steorts, R.C., Two-stage Bayesian benchmarking as applied to small area estimation (2013) Test, 22, pp. 670-687; Hall, P., Maiti, T., On parametric bootstrap methods for small area prediction (2006) J R Stat Soc B, 68, pp. 221-238; Harvey, A., (1989) Forecasting structural time series with the Kalman filter, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:; Hillmer, S.C., Trabelsi, A., Benchmarking of economic time series (1987) J Am Stat Assoc, 82, pp. 1064-1071; Isaki, C.T., Tsay, J.H., Fuller, W.A., Estimation of census adjustment factors (2000) Survey Methodol, 26, pp. 31-42; Lahiri, P., Adjusted” Bayes and empirical Bayes estimation in finite population sampling (1990) Sankhya 52, series B, pp. 50-66; Nandram, B., Sayit, H., A Bayesian analysis of small area probabilities under a constraint (2011) Survey Methodol, 37, pp. 137-152; Pfeffermann, D., New important developments in small area estimation (2013) Stat Sci, 28, pp. 40-68; Pfeffermann, D., Nathan, G., Regression analysis of data from a cluster sample (1981) J Am Stat Assoc, 76, pp. 681-689; Pfeffermann, D., Burck, L., Robust small area estimation combining time series and cross-sectional data (1990) Survey Methodol, 16, pp. 217-237; Pfeffermann, D., Barnard, C.H., Some new estimators for small area means with application to the assessment of farmland values (1991) J Business Econ Stat, 9, pp. 73-83; Pfeffermann, D., Tiller, R.L., Small area estimation with state-space models subject to benchmark constraints (2006) J Am Stat Assoc, 101, pp. 1387-1397; Prasad, N., Rao, J.N.K., The estimation of prediction mean squared error of small area estimators (1990) J Am Stat Assoc, 85, pp. 163-171; Rao, J.N.K., (2003) Small area estimation, , Wiley, New York:; Ugarte, M.D., Militino, A.F., Goicoa, T., Benchmarked estimates in small areas using linear mixed models with restrictions (2009) Test, 18, pp. 342-364; Steorts, R.C., Ghosh, M., On estimation of mean squared errors of benchmarked empirical Bayes Estimators (2014) Stat Sin, , in press; Wang, J., Fuller, W.A., Qu, Y., Small area estimation under a restriction (2008) Survey Methodol, 34, pp. 29-36; You, Y., Rao, J.N.K., A pseudo-empirical best linear unbiased prediction approach to small area estimation using survey weights (2002) Can J Stat, 30, pp. 431-439; You, Y., Rao, J.N.K., Dick, P., Benchmarking hierarchical Bayes small area estimators in the Canadian census undercoverage estimation (2004) Stat Transit, 6, pp. 631-640; You, Y., Rao, J.N.K., Hidiroglou, M., On the performance of self benchmarked small area estimators under the Fay–Herriot area level model (2013) Survey Methodol, 39, pp. 217-229",English,Article

Since time is usually synchronized, discrete-time models come natural. We start this paper with a review of suitable discrete-time queueing models for communication systems. We pay special attention to two important characteristics of communication systems. First, traffic usually arrives in bursts, making the classic modeling of the arrival streams by Poisson processes inadequate and requiring the use of more advanced correlated arrival models. Second, different applications have different quality-of-service requirements (packet loss, packet delay, jitter, etc.). Consequently, the common first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling is not satisfactory and more elaborate scheduling disciplines are required. Both properties make common memoryless queueing models (M/M/1-type models) inadequate. After the review, we therefore concentrate on a discrete-time queueing analysis with two traffic classes, heterogeneous train arrivals and a priority scheduling discipline, as an example analysis where both time correlation and heterogeneity in the arrival process as well as non-FCFS scheduling are taken into account. Focus is on delay performance measures, such as the mean delay experienced by both types of packets and probability tails of these delays. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Analytic methods;

We focus on a rich vehicle routing problem faced by a Portuguese food distribution company on a daily basis. This problem can be described as a heterogeneous fleet site dependent vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows. We use the adaptative large neighbourhood search framework, which has proven to be effective to solve a variety of different vehicle routing problems. Our plans are compared against those of the company and the impact that the proposed decision support tool may have in terms of cost savings is shown. The algorithm converges quickly giving the planner considerably more time to focus on value-added tasks, rather than manually correct the routing schedule. Moreover, contrarily to the necessary adaptation time of the planner, the tool is quite flexible in following market changes, such as the introduction of new customers or new products. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Adaptative large neighbourhood search; Decision support systems; OR in industry; Vehicle routing problem,,"Ambrosino, D., Sciomachen, A., A food distribution network problem: a case study (2006) IMA J Manag Math, 18 (1), pp. 33-53; Amorim, P., Meyr, H., Almeder, C., Almada-Lobo, B., Managing perishability in production-distribution planning: a discussion and review (2011) Flex Serv Manuf J, pp. 1-25. , doi: 10. 1007/s10696-011-9122-3; Bitao, P., Fei, W., Hybrid intelligent algorithm for vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (2010) 2010 International Forum on Information Technology and Applications, pp. 181-184. , New York: IEEE; Chao, I.M., Golden, B., Wasil, E., A computational study of a new heuristic for the site-dependent vehicle routing problem (1999) Infor, 37 (2), pp. 319-336; Chen, H.K., Hsueh, C.F., Chang, M.S., Production scheduling and vehicle routing with time windows for perishable food products (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36 (7), pp. 2311-2319; Cordeau, J., Laporte, G., A tabu search algorithm for the site dependent vehicle routing problem with time windows (2001) Inf Syst Oper Res, 39 (3), pp. 292-298; Doerner, K., Gronalt, M., Hartl, R., Kiechle, G., Reimann, M., Exact and heuristic algorithms for the vehicle routing problem with multiple interdependent time windows (2008) Comput Oper Res, 35 (9), pp. 3034-3048; Faulin, J., Applying MIXALG procedure in a routing problem to optimize food product delivery (2003) Omega, 31 (5), pp. 387-395; Gendreau, M., Potvin, J., (2010) Handbook of Metaheuristics, , 2nd edn., Berlin: Springer+Business Media; Hsu, C.I., Hung, S., Li, H.C., Vehicle routing problem with time-windows for perishable food delivery (2007) J Food Eng, 80, pp. 465-475; (2011) Estatísticas da produção industrial, , http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_publicacoes&PUBLICACOESpub_boui=134140169&PUBLICACOESmodo=2, Instituto Nacional de Estatítica; Jansen, D., Vorst, G., Weert, A., Multi-compartment distribution in the catering supply chain (1998) Int Trans Oper Res, 5 (6), pp. 509-517; Kovacs, A., Parragh, S.N., Doerner, K., Hartl, R., Adaptive large neighborhood search for service technician routing and scheduling problems (2012) J Sched, 15 (5), pp. 579-600; Mullaseril, P., Dror, M., Leung, J., Split-delivery routeing heuristics in livestock feed distribution (1997) J Oper Res Soc, 48 (2), pp. 107-116; Nag, B., Golden, B., Assad, A., Vehicle routing with site dependencies (1998) Vehicle Routing: Methods and Studies, pp. 149-159. , B.

A typical requirement in these problems is a steady flow of harvested timber, mainly to ensure that the industry is able to continue operating with similar levels of machine and labor utilizations. The integer programming approaches described use the so-called volume constraints to impose such a steady yield. These constraints do not directly impose a limit on the global deviation of the volume harvested over the planning horizon or use pre-defined target harvest levels. Addressing volume constraints generally increases the difficulty of solving the integer programming formulations, in particular those proposed for the area restriction model approach. In this paper, we present a new type of volume constraint as well as a multi-objective programming approach to achieve an even flow of timber. We compare the main basic approaches from a computational perspective. The new volume constraints seem to more explicitly control the global deviation of the harvested volume, while the multi-objective approach tends to provide the best profits for a given dispersion of the timber flow. Neither approach substantially changed the computational times involved. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Area restriction model; Forest harvest scheduling; Integer programming; Multi-objective programming; Volume constraint,,"Bertomeu, M., Diaz-Balteiro, L., Giménez, J.C., Forest management optimization in Eucalyptus plantations: a goal programming approach (2009) Can J For Res, 39, pp. 356-366; Bettinger, P., Sessions, J., Johnson, K.N., Ensuring the compatibility of aquatic habitat and commodity production goals in Eastern Oregon with a Tabu Search procedure (1998) For Sci, 44, pp. 96-112; Brumelle, S., Granot, D., Halme, M., Vertinsky, I., A Tabu Search algorithm for finding good forest harvest schedules satisfying green-up constraints (1998) Eur J Oper Res, 106, pp. 408-424; Buongiorno, J., Gilless, J.K., (2003) Decision Methods for Forest Resource Management, , New York: Academic Press; Caro, F., Constantino, M., Martins, I., Weintraub, A., A 2-opt tabu search procedure for the multiperiod forest harvesting problem with adjacency, greenup, old growth, and even flow constraints (2003) For Sci, 49 (5), pp. 738-751; Chalmet, L.G., Lemonidis, L., Elzinga, D.J., An algorithm for the bi-criterion integer programming problem (1986) Eur J Oper Res, 25, pp. 292-300; Clements, S.E., Dallain, P.L., Jamnick, M.S., An operational spatially constrained harvest scheduling model (1990) Can J For Res, 20, pp. 1438-1447; Cohon, J.L., (1978) Multiobjective Programming and Planning, , New York: Academic Press; Constantino, M., Martins, I., Borges, J.G., A new mixed integer programming model for harvest scheduling subject to maximum area restrictions (2008) Oper Res, 56 (3), pp. 542-551; Crowe, K., Nelson, J., Boyland, M., Solving the area-restricted harvest-scheduling model using the branch and bound algorithm (2003) Can J For Res, 33 (9), pp. 1804-1814; Davis, L.S., Johnson, K.N., Bettinger, P., Howard, T., (2001) Forest Management, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Diaz-Balteiro, L., Romero, C., Forest management optimisation models when carbon captured is considered: a goal programming approach (2003) For Ecol Manag, 174, pp. 447-457; Diestel, R., (2000) Graph Theory.

We formulate this problem as a minimization problem with cone constraints, and its dual, which has fewer variables than the original one, is a semismoothly differentiable (SC1) convex programming problem with both a linear inequality constraint and a linear second-order cone constraint. We demonstrate the global convergence of the augmented Lagrangian method with an exact solution to the subproblem and prove that the convergence rate of primal iterates, generated by the augmented Lagrangian method, is proportional to 1/r, and the rate of multiplier iterates is proportional to 1/√r, where r is the penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian. Furthermore, a semismooth Newton method with Armijo line search is constructed to solve the subproblems in the augmented Lagrangian approach. Finally, numerical results are reported to show the effectiveness of the augmented Lagrangian method with both an exact solution and an inexact solution to the subproblem for solving the inverse second-order cone quadratic programming problem. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Augmented Lagrangian method;

The observation is the trait and the composition of the genome at some locations called ""markers"". We focus on the interference phenomenon, i.e. a recombination event inhibits the formation of another recombination event nearby. We give the asymptotic distribution of the LRT process under the null hypothesis that there is no QTL on [0, T] and under local alternatives with a QTL at t{star operator} on [0, T]. We show that the LRT process is asymptotically the square of a ""linear interpolated and normalized process"". We prove that under the null hypothesis, the distribution of the maximum of the LRT process is the same for a model with or without interference.

Nam and Blackwelder derived a Fieller-type statistic from constrained maximum likelihood estimation of nuisance parameters. Although it improved that of Lachenbruch and Lynch, its size still exceeds the claimed nominal level alpha for some cases. This is in accordance with Sidik who has found that the asymptotic tests are inaccurate in testing a hypothesis of a non-zero difference between marginal probabilities. In this paper, we extend Sidik’s exact tests to non-inferiority in ratio, and propose two new methods—one based on the standard (Formula presented.) value and the other from restricted Bayesian estimation using an approximate (Formula presented.) value. Our tests are both based on only one point of the two-dimension nuisance parameter space for accuracy improvement and computational purposes. The sizes and powers of our tests are considered. Simulation results suggest that our tests can control the type I error rates well with competitive powers while the Fieller-type statistic cannot for some cases be investigated. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Approximate (Formula presented.) value; Bayesian estimation; Matched-pairs sample; Non-inferiority testing,,"Bartlett, M.S., Approximate confidence intervals: more than one Unknown parameter (1953) Biometrika, 40, pp. 306-317; Casella, G., Berger, R.L., (1990) Statistical inference, , Wadsworth, California:; Chen, J.J., Tsong, Y., Kang, S.H., Tests for equivalence or non-inferiority between two proportions (2000) Drug Inf J, 34, pp. 569-578; Chen, W.Q., Jin, H., A new non-inferiority test based on Bayesian estimation in matched-pairs design (2012) Stat Interface, 5 (4), pp. 443-449; Lachenbruch, P.A., Lynch, C.J., Assessing screening tests: extensions of McNemar’s test (1998) Stat Med, 17, pp. 2207-2217; Lu, Y., Bean, J.A., On the sample size for studies of bioequivalence based upon McNemar’s test (1995) Stat Med, 14, pp. 1831-1839; Nam, J., Establishing equivalence of two treatments and sample size requirements in matched-pairs design (1997) Biometrics, 53, pp. 1422-1430; Nam, J., Blackwelder, W.C., Analysis of the ratio of marginal probabilities in a matched-pair setting (2002) Stat Med, 21, pp. 689-699; Sidik, K., Exact unconditional tests for testing non-inferiority in matched-pairs design (2003) Stat Med, 22, pp. 265-278; Tango, T., Equivalence test and confidence interval for the difference in proportions for the paired-sample design (1998) Stat Med, 17, pp. 891-908; Van Raden, M.J., Blackwelder, W.C., Van Sant, F.D., Shrager, R.I., Nam, J., Paired dichotomous data: test and confidence interval for ratio of marginal proportions.

Several aspects of practical relevance are captured, namely, multiple echelons with different types of facilities, product flows between facilities in the same echelon, direct shipments to customers, and facility relocation. A two-phase heuristic approach is proposed to obtain high-quality feasible solutions to the problem, which is initially modeled as a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. In the first phase of the heuristic, a linear programming rounding strategy is applied to find initial values for the binary location variables. The second phase of the heuristic uses local search to correct the initial variable choices when a feasible solution is not identified, or to improve the initial feasible solution when its quality does not meet given criteria. The results of a computational study are reported for randomly generated instances comprising a variety of logistics networks. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Heuristic; Linear programming; Local search; Logistics network redesign; Rounding,,"Ahmed, S., Sahinidis, N.V., An approximate scheme for stochastic integer programming arising in capacity expansion (2003) Oper Res, 51, pp. 461-471; Ahmed, S., King, A., Parija, G., A multi-stage stochastic integer programming approach for capacity expansion under uncertainty (2003) J Glob Optim, 26, pp. 3-24; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Garín, A., Ortuño, M.T., Pérez, G., An approach for strategic supply chain planning under uncertainty based on stochastic 0-1 programming (2003) J Glob Optim, 26, pp. 97-124; Ambrosino, D., Scutellà, M.G., Distribution network design: new problems and related models (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 165, pp. 610-624; Ballou, R.H., Dynamic warehouse location analysis (1968) J Mark Res, 5, pp. 271-276; Canel, C., Khumawala, B.M., Law, J., Loh, A., An algorithm for the capacitated, multi-commodity multi-period facility location problem (2001) Comput Oper Res, 28, pp. 411-427; Chudak, F., Shmoys, D., Improved approximation algorithms for the uncapacitated facility location problem (2004) SIAM J Comput, 33, pp. 1-25; Cordeau, J.F., Pasin, F., Solomon, M.M., An integrated model for logistics network design (2006) Ann Oper Res, 144, pp. 59-82; Daskin, M., Snyder, L., Berger, R., Facility location in supply chain design (2005) Logistics Systems: Design and Optimization, pp. 39-65. , Chap 2, A.

Constant retrial rate is typical for some real world systems where the intensity of individual retrials is inversely proportional to the number of customers in the orbit or only one customer from the orbit is allowed to make the retrials. In our model, a customer who finds the server busy joins the queue in the orbit in accordance with the FCFS (first-come-first-out) discipline and only the oldest customer in the queue is allowed to make the repeated attempts to reach the server. A distinguishing feature of the considered system is an arbitrary distribution of inter-arrival times, while the overwhelming majority of the papers is devoted to the retrial systems with the stationary Poisson arrival process. We carry out an extensive analytical analysis of the queue in steady state using the well-known matrix analytic technique. The ergodicity condition and simple expressions for the stationary distributions of the system states at pre-arrival, post-arrival and arbitrary times are derived. The important and difficult problem of finding the stationary distribution of the sojourn time is solved in terms of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform. Little's formula is proved.

(Test, 2014) provide a nice showcase of the flexibility of latent Markov models for longitudinal data. Indeed, their list of applications is impressive and includes a wide variety of models, with covariates to model transitions between latent states and direct effects on the observations, such that the model becomes a latent Markov regression model, and models for multivariate data, to mention but a few. Bartolucci et al. also briefly discuss the relationship between latent Markov models and hidden Markov models. These models share their basic assumptions, but were developed with different objectives in mind: the latent Markov model is aimed at longitudinal data, whereas the hidden Markov model is aimed at modeling time-series data. As a result of this difference in focus, different estimation and inference methods have been developed, which each have their strengths and weaknesses. Surprisingly, the literatures on latent and hidden Markov models have remained largely separate. We believe that a marriage between these literatures can provide even greater flexibility to this modeling framework than each of them can muster separately. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Contingency table; Continuous time observations; Hidden Markov model; Missing data; Psychology; Software,,"Bartolucci, F., Farcomeni, A., Pennoni, F., Latent Markov models: a review of a general framework for the analysis longitudinal data with covariates (2014) TEST, , doi: 10. 1007/s11749-014-0390-6; Bartolucci, F., (2012) University of Perugia, and LMest: Fit latent Markov models in basic versions, 2012, , http://www.stat.unipg.it/bartolucci, R package version 1. 0; Baum, L.E., Petrie, T., Statistical inference for probabilistic functions of finite state Markov chains (1966) Ann Math Stat, 67, pp. 1554-1563. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/2238772; Beketov, M.A., (2014) HMMCont: Hidden Markov model for continuous observations processes, 2014, , R package version 1. 0; Bulla, J., Bulla, I., Stylized facts of financial time series and hidden semi-Markov models (2006) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51 (4), pp. 2192-2209; Bunge, S.A., Zelazo, P.D., A brain-based account of the development of rule use in childhood (2006) Current Direct Psychol Sci, 15 (3), pp. 118-121; Chomsky, N., On certain formal properties of grammars (1959) Inf Control, 2, pp. 137-167; Dutilh, G., Wagenmakers, E.-J., Visser, I., van der Maas, H.L.J., A phase transition model for the speed-accuracy trade-off in response time experiments (2011) Cogn Sci, 35, pp. 211-250; Hamilton, J.D., A new approach to the economic analysis of nonstationary time series and the business cycle (1989) Econom J Econom Soc, 57 (2), pp. 357-384; Harte, D., (2010) HiddenMarkov: Hidden Markov models, 2010, , R package version 1. 3-1; Himmelmann, L., (2010) HMM: HMM-hidden Markov models, , Scientific Software Development, 2010.

They develop a novel two-stage benchmarking method for hierarchical time series models, where they evaluate their procedure by estimating monthly total unemployment using data from the US Census Bureau. We discuss three topics: linearity and model misspecification, computational complexity and model comparisons, and, some aspects on small area estimation in practice. More specifically, we pose the following questions to the authors, that they may wish to answer: How robust is their model to misspecification? Is it time to perhaps move away from linear models of the type considered by Fay and Herriot (J Am Stat Assoc 74:269–277, 1979), Battese et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 83:28–36, 1988)? What is the asymptotic computational complexity and what comparisons can be made to other models? Should the benchmarking constraints be inherently fixed or should they be random?. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",,,"Battese, G., Harter, R., Fuller, W., An error-components model for prediction of county crop area using survey and satellite data (1988) J Am Stat Assoc, 83, pp. 28-36; Bell, W., Datta, G., Ghosh, M., Benchmarked small area estimators (2013) Biometrika, 100, pp. 189-202; Datta, G., Ghosh, M., Steorts, R., Maples, J., Bayesian benchmarking with applications to small area estimation (2011) Test, 20, pp. 574-588; Fay, R., Herriot, R., Estimates of income from small places: an application of James-Stein procedures to census data (1979) J Am Stat Assoc, 74, pp. 269-277; Ghosh, M., Steorts, R., Two-stage Bayesian benchmarking as applied to small area estimation (2013) TEST, 22, pp. 670-687; Militino, A.F., Goicoa, T., Ugarte, M.D., Estimating the percentage of food expenditure in small areas using bias-corrected p-spline based estimators (2012) Comput Stat Data Anal, 53, pp. 3616-3629; Molina, I., Marhuenda, Y., (2013) Package sae, , http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sae/sae.pdf; Pfeffermann, D., New important developments in small area estimation (2013) Stat Sci, 28, pp. 40-68; Pfeffermann, D., Sikov, A., Tiller, R., Single and two-stage cross-sectional and time series benchmarking procedures for small area estimation (2014) TEST (to appear); Steorts, R., Louis, T., Constrained Bayesian benchmarking (2014) Preparation; Stodden, V., Borwein, J., Bailey, D.H., Setting the default to reproducible in computational science research.

A pair of points (Ai,Aj) is called covered if the time to access the network from Ai plus the time for traveling along the network plus the time for reaching Aj is lower than, or equal to, a given acceptance level related to the travel time without using the network. The objective is to find facilities (i.e. entry and exit points) on the network that maximize the number of covered pairs. We present a reformulation of the problem using convex covering sets and use this formulation to derive a finite dominating set and an algorithm for locating two facilities on a tree network. Moreover, we adapt a geometric branch and bound approach to the discrete nature of the problem and suggest a procedure for locating more than two facilities on a single line, which is evaluated numerically. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Covering problem; Location; Transportation,,"Abellanas, M., Hurtado, F., Sacristán, V., Icking, C., Ma, L., Klein, R., Langetep, E., Palop, B., Voronoi diagram for services neighboring a highway (2003) Inf Process Lett, 86, pp. 283-288; Abellanas, M., Hurtado, F., Palop, B., The heavy luggage metric (2008) Int J Comput Geom Appl, 18, pp. 295-306; Bae, S.W., Kim, J.H., Chwa, K.Y., Optimal construction of the city voronoi diagram (2009) Int J Comput Geom, 19, pp. 95-117; Berman, O., Krass, D., Drezner, Z., The gradual covering decay location problem on a network (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 474-480; Blanquero, R., Carrizosa, E., Continuous location problems and big triangle small triangle: constructing better bounds (2009) J Glob Optim, 45, pp. 389-402; Cardinal, J., Collette, S., Hurtado, F., Langerman, S., Palop, B., Optimal location of transportation devices (2008) Comput Geom, 41, pp. 319-329; Carrizosa, E., Rodríguez-Chía, A., Weber problems with alternative transportation systems (1997) Eur J Oper Res, 97, pp. 87-93; Dearing, P., Francis, R.L., Lowe, T.J., Convex location problems on tree networks (1976) Oper Res, 24, pp. 628-642; Görke, R., Shin, C.S., Wolff, A., Constructing the city voronoi diagram faster (2008) Int J Comput Geom Appl, 18, pp. 275-294; Hansen, P., Peeters, D., Richard, D., Thisse, J.F., The minisum and minimax location problems revisited (1985) Oper Res, 33, pp. 1251-1265; Horst, R., Thoai, N., DC programming: overview (1999) J Optim Theory Appl, 103, pp. 1-43; Kirwan, F., (1992) Complex Algebraic Curves, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Koolen, A., Tamir, A., Covering problems (1990) Discrete Location Theory, , P.

To allow for analyzing complex data situations, several flexible regression models have been introduced. Among these are the varying coefficient models, that differ from a classical linear regression model by the fact that the regression coefficients are no longer constant but functions that vary with the value taken by another variable, such as for example, time. In this paper, we study quantile regression in varying coefficient models for longitudinal data. The quantile function is modeled as a function of the covariates and the main task is to estimate the unknown regression coefficient functions. We approximate each coefficient function by means of P-splines. Theoretical properties of the estimators, such as rate of convergence and an asymptotic distribution are established. The estimation methodology requests solving an optimization problem that also involves a smoothing parameter. For a special case the optimization problem can be transformed into a linear programming problem for which then a Frisch-Newton interior point method is used, leading to a computationally fast and efficient procedure. Several data-driven choices of the smoothing parameters are briefly discussed, and their performances are illustrated in a simulation study. Some real data analysis demonstrates the use of the developed method. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",B-splines; Longitudinal data; P-splines; Quantile regression; Varying coefficient models,,"Antoniadis, A., Gijbels, I., Nikolova, M., Penalized likelihood regression for generalized linear models with nonquadratic penalties (2011) Ann Inst Stat Math, 63, pp. 585-615; Antoniadis, A., Gijbels, I., Verhasselt, A., Variable selection in varying coefficient models using P-splines (2012) J Comput Graph Stat, 21, pp. 638-661; Bang, S., Jhun, M., Simultaneous estimation and factor selection in quantile regression via adaptive sup-norm regularization (2012) Comput Stat Data Anal, 56, pp. 813-826; Bernstein, D.S., (2009) Matrix Mathematics.

Here, we incorporate space-time wind forecasts into electric power system scheduling. First, we propose a modified regime-switching, space-time wind speed forecasting model that allows the forecast regimes to vary with the dominant wind direction and with the seasons, hence avoiding a subjective choice of regimes. Then, results from the wind forecasts are incorporated into a power system economic dispatch model, the cost of which is used as a loss measure of the quality of the forecast models. This, in turn, leads to cost-effective scheduling of system-wide wind generation. Potential economic benefits arise from the system-wide generation of cost savings and from the ancillary service cost savings. We illustrate the economic benefits using a test system in the northwest region of the United States. Compared with persistence and autoregressive models, our model suggests that cost savings from integration of wind power could be on the scale of tens of millions of dollars annually in regions with high wind penetration, such as Texas and the Pacific northwest. © 2014 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Correlation; Cost savings; Power system economic dispatch; Space-time statistical model; Wind energy; Wind speed forecasting,,"Ackermann, T., (2005) Wind power in power systems, , http://books.google.com/books?id=NcMws2-N3BMC, Wiley, New York; Bouffard, F., Galiana, F.D., Stochastic security for operations planning with significant sind power generation (2008) Proceeding of power and energy society general meeting-conversion and delivery of electrical energy in the 21st Century, pp. 1-11. , 2008 IEEE; (2007) BPA total transmission system load, , BPA, Bonneville Power Administration; (2010) 2009 BPA facts, , Bonneville Power Administration, BPA; Constantinescu, E.M., Zavala, V.M., Rocklin, M., Sangmin, L., Anitescu, M., A computational framework for uncertainty quantification and stochastic optimization in unit commitment with wind power generation (2011) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 26 (1), pp. 431-441; (2010) CREIA 2010 China wind power outlook, , CREIA, China Renewable Energy Industries Association; Denny, E., O'Malley, M., Wind generation, power system operation, and emissions reduction (2006) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 21 (1), pp. 341-347. , doi:10.1109/TPWRS.2005.857845; (2008) 20 % Wind energy by 2030: Increasing wind energy's contribution to U.

The particular form of GIG densities, involving modified Bessel functions, prevents in general form a closed-form expression for ML estimators, which are obtained at the expense of complex numerical approximation methods. On the contrary, Method of Moments (MM) estimators allow for concise expressions, but tests based on these estimators suffer from a lack of efficiency as compared to likelihood ratio tests. This is why, in recent years, trade-offs between ML and MM estimators have been proposed, resulting in simpler yet not completely efficient estimators and tests. In the present paper, we do not propose such a trade-off but rather an optimal combination of both methods, our tests inheriting efficiency from an ML-like construction and simplicity from the MM estimators of the nuisance parameters. This goal shall be reached by attacking the problem from a new angle, namely via the Le Cam methodology. Besides providing simple efficient testing methods, the theoretical background of this methodology further allows us to write out explicitly power expressions for our tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that, also at small sample sizes, our simpler procedures do at least as good as the complex likelihood ratio tests. We conclude the paper by applying our findings on two real-data sets. © 2014, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic linearity; GIG distributions; IG distributions; Maximin tests; Uniform local asymptotic normality,,"Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Halgreen, C., Infinite divisibility of the Hyperbolic and generalized inverse Gaussian distribution (1977) Z Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verw Gebiete, 38, pp. 309-312; Bickel, P.J., Klaassen, C.A.J., Ritov, Y., Wellner, J.A., (1993) Efficient and adaptive statistical inference for semiparametric models, , Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore:; Chebana, F., El Adlouni, S., Bobée, B., Mixed estimation methods for Halphen distributions with applications in extreme hydrologic events (2010) Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess, 24, pp. 359-376; Chhikara, R.S., Folks, L., (1989) The inverse Gaussian distribution: theory, methodology, and applications, , Marcel Dekker, New York:; Fitzgerald, D.L., Statistical aspects of Tricomi’s function and modified Bessel functions of the second kind (2000) Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess, 14, pp. 139-158; Good, I.J., The population frequencies of species and the estimation of population parameters (1953) Biometrika, 40, pp. 237-264; Halphen, E., Sur un nouveau type de courbe de fréquence (1941) Comptes Rendus de l’Académie des Sciences, 213, pp. 633-635. , (Published under the name of “Dugué” due to war constraints); Iyengar, S., Liao, Q., Modeling neural activity using the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution (1997) Biol Cybern, 77, pp. 289-295; Jørgensen, B., (1982) Statistical properties of the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution, , Springer, Heidelberg:; Kreiss, J.-P., On adaptive estimation in stationary ARMA processes (1987) Ann Stat, 15, pp. 112-133; Le Cam, L., Locally asymptotically normal families of distribution (1960) Univ Calif Publ Stat, 3, pp. 37-98; Le Cam, L., Yang, G.L., (2000) Asymptotics in statistics, , Some basic concepts, Springer, New York:; Lemonte, A.J., Cordeiro, G.M., The exponentiated generalized inverse Gaussian distribution (2011) Stat Probab Lett, 81, pp. 506-517; Mudholkar, S.M., Tian, L., An entropy characterization of the inverse Gaussian distribution and related goodness-of-fit test (2002) J Stat Plan Inference, 102, pp. 211-221; Natarajan, R., Mudholkar, G.S., Moment-based goodness-of-fit tests for the inverse Gaussian distribution (2004) Technometrics, 46, pp. 339-347; Perreault, L., Bobée, B., Rasmussen, P.F., Halphen distribution system.

It basically consists of two parts: a review of the literature, focusing on the modelling of information streams and on scheduling disciplines (Sects. 2, 3), and a demonstration of some key methods for the analysis of discrete-time queueing systems, focusing on a particular two-class discrete-time queue with correlated arrivals and two priority classes (Sects. 4-6). In Sect. 1 of the present note, we make some introductory comments. In Sect. 2, realizing that the literature review in Bruneel et al. (TOP, 2014) is authoritative and extensive, we focus on a few adjacent topics which fall outside the scope of Bruneel et al. (TOP, 2014) but which in our view may also be of some interest. Finally, in Sect. 3, we discuss the analysis in Sects. 4-6 of Bruneel et al.

This paper discusses a methodology for investigating whether it can be concluded that the k unknown distributions, or any subsets of these distributions, can be taken to be equal to a common normal distribution, and if so it is shown how to identify these common normal distributions. This is accomplished with an exact specified error rate by constructing confidence sets for the parameters of the common normal distributions using Kolmogorov's (G. Ist. Ital. Attuari 4:83-91, 1933) procedure. The relationship of this methodology to standard tests of normality and to standard procedures for constructing confidence sets for the parameters of a normal distribution are discussed, together with its relationship to functional data analysis and other standard test procedures for data of this kind.

Res. 55:109-125, 1985) and Weir and Mond (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 136:29-38, 1988) introduced the concept of preinvex function. The preinvex functions have some interesting properties. For example, every local minimum of a preinvex function is a global minimum and nonnegative linear combinations of preinvex functions are preinvex. Invex functions were introduced by Hanson (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 80:545-550, 1981) as a generalization of differentiable convex functions. These functions are more general than the convex and pseudo convex ones. The type of invex function is equivalent to the type of function whose stationary points are global minima. Under some conditions, an invex function is also a preinvex function. Syau (Fuzzy Sets Syst. 115:455-461, 2000) introduced the concepts of pseudoconvexity, invexity, and pseudoinvexity for fuzzy mappings of one variable by using the notion of differentiability and the results proposed by Goestschel and Voxman (Fuzzy Sets Syst. 18:31-43, 1986). Wu and Xu (Fuzzy Sets Syst 159:2090-2103, 2008) introduced the concepts of fuzzy pseudoconvex, fuzzy invex, fuzzy pseudoinvex, and fuzzy preinvex mapping from ℝn to the set of fuzzy numbers based on the concept of differentiability of fuzzy mapping defined by Wang and Wu (Fuzzy Sets Syst. 138:559-591, 2003). In this paper, we present some characterizations of preinvex fuzzy mappings. The necessary and sufficient conditions for differentiable and twice differentiable preinvex fuzzy mapping are provided. These characterizations correct and improve previous results given by other authors. This fact is shown with examples. Moreover, we introduce additional conditions under which these results are valid. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Differentiability of fuzzy mapping; Fuzzy optimization; Invex fuzzy mappings;

Economic, social and environmental aspects must be taken into account in order to design appropriate policies and thus, multicriteria analysis becomes a very adequate tool to deal with real problems of this kind. This study was directed by the Regional Ministry of Environment of Andalucía, who wanted to know the impact on the cost and on the environmental damage of a potential mix, more focused on renewable sources. Some authorities of the Ministry acted as decision maker in the interactive process. As a result, we have built a linear multiobjective model, in order to determine the optimal electrical mix for the Spanish region of Andalucía. Namely, we determine how much electricity power should be installed and produced, by each of the eight generation systems considered (lignite, other coals, oil, natural gas, nuclear, photovoltaic, wind and mini-hydro). Apart from the economic criterion (yearly cost), we have considered the vulnerability (in terms of percentage of imported fuel) as a strategic criterion, and 12 environmental criteria, which have been derived using the Life Cycle Analysis method on the different production systems. The interactive system PROMOIN was used to solve the multiobjective problem. PROMOIN allows the decision maker to choose how to give preference information to the system, and enables changing it anytime during the solution process, which gives more flexibility to the decision maker and increases the confidence of the decision maker in the final solution. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Electricity supply; Interactive methods; Multiobjective programming; Renewable energy; Sustainable development,,"Akimoto, K., Fujii, Y., Sekiguchi, T., Yamaji, K., Decision analysis under uncertain CO2 regulation policies with a global energy model and its implication for power system planning (1998) Int J Glob Energy Issues, 11, pp. 33-41; Alanne, K., Salo, A., Saari, A., Gustafsson, S.I., Multi-criteria evaluation of residential energy supply systems (2007) Energy Build, 39, pp. 1218-1226; Antunes, C., Martins, A., Preface (2003) Ann Oper Res, 120, pp. 15-17; Antunes, C., Martins, A., Preface (2003) Ann Oper Res, 121, pp. 15-17; Belton, V., Greco, S., Eskelinen, P., Molina, J., Ruiz, F., Slowinski, R., Interactive multiobjective optimization from a learning perspective (2008) Multiobjective Optimization: Interactive and Evolutionary Approaches, pp. 405-434. , J.

These PCD families are proportional edge (PE) and central similarity (CS) PCDs and are defined with proximity regions based on relative positions of data points from two classes. The relative densities of these PCDs were previously used as statistics for testing segregation and association patterns against complete spatial randomness. The relative density of a digraph, D, with n vertices (i.e., with order n) represents the ratio of the number of arcs in D to the number of arcs in the complete symmetric digraph of the same order. When scaled properly, the relative density of a PCD is a U-statistic; hence, it has asymptotic normality by the standard central limit theory of U-statistics. The PE- and CS-PCDs are defined with an expansion parameter that determines the size or measure of the associated proximity regions. In this article, we extend the distribution of the relative density of CS-PCDs for expansion parameter being larger than one, and compare finite sample performance of the tests by Monte Carlo simulations and asymptotic performance by Pitman asymptotic efficiency. We find the optimal expansion parameters of the PCDs for testing each alternative in finite samples and in the limit as the sample size tending to infinity. As a result of our comparisons, we demonstrate that in terms of empirical power (i.e., for finite samples) relative density of CS-PCD has better performance (which occurs for expansion parameter values larger than one) for the segregation alternative, while relative density of PE-PCD has better performance for the association alternative. The methods are also illustrated in a real-life data set from plant ecology. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Association; Complete spatial randomness; Delaunay triangulation; Pitman asymptotic efficiency; Proximity catch digraphs; Segregation; U-statistic,,"Baddeley, A.J., Turner, R., Spatstat: an R package for analyzing spatial point patterns (2005) J Stat Softw, 12 (6), pp. 1-42; Beer, E., Fill, J.A., Janson, S., Scheinerman, E.R., (2010) On vertex, edge, and vertex-edge random graphs, , arXiv: 0812. 1410v2 [math.

Nevertheless, most papers on this subject demonstrate that important reductions can be made to generate rule sets by searching and removing redundancies and conflicts and simplifying the similarities between them. The objective of this paper is to present an algorithm (RBS: Reduction Based on Significance) for allocating a significance value to each rule in the system so that experts may select the rules that should be considered as preferable and understand the exact degree of correlation between the different rule attributes. Significance is calculated from the antecedent frequency and rule frequency parameters for each rule; if the first one is above the minimal level and rule frequency is in a critical interval, its significance ratio is computed by the algorithm. These critical boundaries are calculated by an incremental method and the rule space is divided according to them. The significance function is defined for these intervals. As with other methods of rule reduction, our approach can also be applied to rule sets generated from decision trees or frequency counting algorithms, in an independent way and after the rule set has been created. Three simulated data sets are used to carry out a computational experiment. Other standard data sets from UCI repository (UCI Machine Learning Repository) and two particular data sets with expert interpretation are used too, in order to obtain a greater consistency. The proposed method offers a more reduced and more easily understandable rule set than the original sets, and highlights the most significant attribute correlations quantifying their influence on consequent attribute. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Classification rules; Reduction; Significance measures,,"Aggarwal, C.C., Yu, P.S., A new framework for itemset generation (1998) Proc 17th Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, pp. 18-24; Agrawal, R., Srikant, R., Fast algorithms for mining association rules (1994) Proc 20th Conference on Very Large Database, pp. 487-499; Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A., Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases (1993) Proc ACM Sigmod Conference, pp. 207-216; Bayardo, R., Agrawal, R., Mining the most interesting rules (1999) Proc 5th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery, pp. 145-154; Brassard, G., Bratley, P., (1995) Fundamentals of Algoritmics, , New York: Pearson/Prentice Hall; Chen, G., Liu, H., Yu, L., Wei, Q., Zhang, X., A new approach to classification based on association rule mining (2006) Decis Support Syst, 42, pp. 674-689; Garey, M.R., Johnson, D.S., (1979) A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, , New York: Freeman; Hand, D., Mannila, H., Smyth, P., (2001) Principles of Data Mining, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Li, J., Cercone, N., Introducing a rule importance measure (2006) Transactions on Rough Sets V, pp. 167-189. , J.

To improve the efficiency of human resources, we need to provide an optimal working schedule for each worker in production period. In this paper, we proposed a mixed-integer nonlinear model to find the best working schedule based on product quality cost and workers reliability. In this model, if the worker's exhaustion level reaches a specific limit, the worker can rest to increase his reliability level and an accommodator should work instead of him. Since the proposed model is NP-hard, we used an artificial immune system to provide the best working schedule. The results indicate that this model can provide efficient and effective human resources schedule in manufacturing systems. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Artificial immune system; Optimization; Quality control; Reliability,,,English,Article in Press

The analysis of the results shows that the clustering approach exhibits good performance also when compared with other reduction approaches. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2013.",Clustering algorithms; Portfolio optimization; Scenario tree reduction; Stochastic programming,,"Artzner, P., Delbaen, F., Eber, J.M., Heath, D., Coherent measures of risk (1999) Math Financ, 9, pp. 203-228; Beraldi, P., De Simone, F., Violi, A., Generating scenario trees: A parallel integrated simulationoptimization approach (2010) J Comput Appl Math, 23 (9), pp. 2322-2331; Beraldi, P., Bruni, P., De Simone, F., (2010) Clustering algorithms for scenario reduction, , Technical Report Lab. of Financial Engineering, DEIS, University of Calabria; Beraldi, P., De Simone, F., Violi, A., A decision support system for asset liability management (2011) Decis Support Systems, 51 (3), pp. 549-561; Bertocchi, M., Dupacová, J., Moriggia, V., Horizon and stages in applications of stochastic programming in finance (2006) Ann Oper Res, 142, pp. 63-78; Consigli, G., Dempster, M., Dynamic stochastic programming for asset liability management (1998) Ann Oper Res, 81, pp. 131-161; de Oliveira, W.L., Sagastiz, C., Pennay, D.D.J., Maceiray, M.E.P., Damazio, J.M., Optimal scenario tree reduction for stochastic streamflows in power generation planning problems (2010) Optim Methods Softw, 25, pp. 917-936; Dupacová, J., Consigli, G., Wallace, S.W., Scenarios for multistage stochastic programs (2000) Ann Oper Res, 100, pp. 25-53; Dupacová, J., Gröwe-Kuska, N., Römisch, W., Scenario reduction in stochastic programming: An approach using probability metrics (2003) Math Program, 95, pp. 493-511; Geyer, A., Hanke, M., Wiessensteiner, A., No-arbitrage conditions scenario trees and multi-asset financial optimization (2010) Eur J Op Res, 2006 (3), pp. 609-613; Gülpinar, N., Rustem, B., Settergren, R., Simulation and optimization approaches to scenario tree generation (2004) J Econ Dyn Control, 28, pp. 1291-1315; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Scenario reduction algorithms in stochastic programming (2003) Comp Optim Appl, 24, pp. 187-206; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Stability and scenario trees for multistage stochastic programs (2006) Stochastic programming-the state of the art, , Infanger G (ed); Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., A note on scenario reduction for two-stage stochastic programs (2007) Oper Res Let, 35, pp. 731-736; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Scenario tree modeling for multistage stochastic programs (2009) Math Program, 118, pp. 371-406; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Scenario tree reduction for multistage stochastic programs (2009) Comput Manag Sci, 6, pp. 117-133; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Strungarek, C., ) Stability in multistage stochastic programming (2006) SIAM J Optimi, 17, pp. 501-525; Henrion, R., Küchler, C., Römisch, W., Discrepancy distances and scenario reduction in two-stage stochastic integer programming (2008) J Ind Manage Optim, 4, pp. 363-384; Henrion, R., Küchler, C., Römisch, W., Scenario reduction in stochastic programming with respect to discrepancy distances (2009) Comp Optim Appl, 43, pp. 67-93; Kaut, M., Wallace, S.W., Evaluation of scenario generation methods for stochastic programming (2007) Pac J Optim, 3, pp. 257-271; Kaufman, L., Rousseeuw, P.J., (1990) Finding groups in data: An introduction to cluster analysis, , Wiley, New york; Latorre, J.M., Cerisola, S., Ramos, A., Clustering algorithms for scenario tree generation: Application to natural hydro inflows (2007) Europ J Oper Res, 181, pp. 1339-1353; Römisch, W., Stability of stochastic programming problems (2003) Stochastic programming, handbooks in operations research and management science, 10, pp. 483-554. , Ruszczynski A, Shapiro A (eds), Amsterdam, Elsevier; Ruszczynski, A., Shapiro, A., (2008) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science: Stochastic Programming, , Elsevier; Sutiene, K., Makackas, D., Pranevicius, H., K-Means clustering for scenario tree construction (2010) Inform, 21, pp. 123-138; Szego, G., (2004) Risk measures for 21st century, , Wiley, New York; Zenios, S.A., Ziemba, W.T., (2006) Handbook of Asset and Liability Management, Volume 1: Theory and Methodology, , Elsevier; Zenios, S.A., Ziemba, W.T., (2007) Handbook of Asset and Liability Management, Volume 2: Applications and Case Studies, , Elsevier",English,Article

When the distribution of returns of risky assets is unknown but the mean return vector and variance/covariance matrix of the risky assets are fixed, we derive the distributionally robust portfolio rules. Then, we address uncertainty (ambiguity) in the mean return vector in addition to distribution ambiguity, and derive the optimal portfolio rules when the uncertainty in the return vector is modeled via an ellipsoidal uncertainty set. In the presence of a riskless asset, the robust CVaR and VaR measures, coupled with a minimum mean return constraint, yield simple, mean-variance efficient optimal portfolio rules. In a market without the riskless asset, we obtain a closed-form portfolio rule that generalizes earlier results, without a minimum mean return restriction. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Conditional Value-at-Risk; Distributional robustness; Ellipsoidal uncertainty; Robust portfolio choice; Value-at-Risk,,,English,Article in Press

We develop a novel two-stage benchmarking methodology using a single weighted squared error loss function that combines the loss at the unit level and the area level without any specific distributional assumptions. This loss is considered while benchmarking the weighted means at each level or both the weighted means and weighted variability at the unit level. Furthermore, we provide multivariate extensions for benchmarking weighted means at both levels. The behavior of our methods is analyzed using a complex study from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2000, which estimates the proportion of people that do not have health insurance for many domains of an Asian subpopulation. Finally, the methodology is explored via simulated data under the proposed model. Ultimately, three proposed benchmarked Bayes estimators do not dominate each other, leaving much exploration for further understanding of such complex studies such as the choice of weights, optimal algorithms for efficiency, as well as extensions to multi-stage benchmarking methods. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian methodology; Benchmarking; Complex survey; Decision theory; MCMC; Small area estimation; Weighting,,"Wang, J., Fuller, W.A., Qu, Y., Small area estimation under a restriction (2008) Surv Methodol, 34, pp. 29-36; Ugarte, M.D., Goicoa, T., Militino, A.F., Benchmarked estimates in small areas using linear mixed models with restrictions (2009) Test, 18, pp. 342-364; Battese, G., Harter, R., Fuller, W., An error-components model for prediction of county crop area using survey and satellite data (1988) J Am Stat Assoc, 83, pp. 28-36; Datta, G.S., Ghosh, M., Steorts, R., Maples, J., Bayesian benchmarking with applications to small area estimation (2011) Test, 20 (3), pp. 574-588; Bell, W.R., Datta, G.S., Ghosh, M., Benchmarked small area estimators (2013) Biometrika, 100 (1), pp. 189-202; Ghosh, M., Kim, D., Sinha, K., Maiti, T., Katzoff, M., Parsons, V., Hierarchical and empirical Bayes small domain estimation of the proportion of persons without health insurance or minority subpopulations (2009) Surv Methodol, 35 (1), pp. 53-66; Ghosh, M., Natarajan, K., Stroud, T., Carlin, B., Generalized linear models for small area-estimation (1998) J Am Stat Assoc, 93 (441), pp. 53-66; Isaki, C.T., Tsay, J.H., Fuller, W.A., Weighting sample data subject to independent controls (2004) Surv Methodol, 20, pp. 35-44",English,Article

For such classes of stationary sequences, there exists the upcrossings index η, 0≤η≤1, which is directly related to the extremal index θ, 0≤θ≤1, for suitable high levels. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the upcrossings index η for a class of stationary sequences satisfying a mild oscillation restriction. For the proposed estimator, properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality are studied. Finally, the performance of the estimator is assessed through simulation studies for autoregressive processes and case studies in the fields of environment and finance.

Fan et al. (in J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 107:592-606, 2012a) addressed the problem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio selection. In this paper, we present a direct approach to estimate the risk for vast portfolios using asynchronous and noisy high-frequency data. This approach alleviates accumulation of the estimation error of tens of hundreds of integrated volatilities (or co-volatilities), and on the other hand it has the advantage of smoothing away the microstructure noise in the spatial direction. Based on the simple approach, together with the ""pre-averaging"" technique, we obtain a sharper bound of the risk approximation error than that in Fan et al. (in J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 107:412-428, 2012b). This bound is locally dependent on the allocation plan satisfying the gross-exposure constraint. The bound does not require exponential tail of the distribution of the microstructure noise. Finite fourth moment suffices. Our work also demonstrates that the mean squared error of the risk estimator can be decreased by choosing an optimal tuning parameter depending on the allocation plan. This is more pronounced for the moderately high-frequency data. Our theoretical results are further confirmed by simulations. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Gross-exposure constraint; Itô process; Vast portfolio,,"Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Hansen, P.R., Lunde, A., Shephard, N., Multivariate realized kernels: consistent positive semi-definite estimators of the covariation of equity prices with noise and non-synchronous trading (2008) J Econom, 162, pp. 149-169; Fan, J., Fan, Y., Lv, J., Large dimensional covariance matrix estimation via a factor model (2008) J Econom, 147, pp. 186-197; Fan, J., Wang, Y., Multi-scale jump and volatility analysis for high-frequency financial data (2007) J Am Stat Assoc, 102, pp. 1349-1362; Fan, J., Zhang, J., Yu, K., Asset allocation and risk assessment with gross exposure constraints for vast portfolios (2012) J Am Stat Assoc, 107, pp. 592-606; Fan, J., Li, Y., Ke, Y., Vast volatility matrix estimation using high frequency data for portfolio selection (2012) J Am Stat Assoc, 107, pp. 412-428; Frost, P.A., Savarino, J.E., An empirical Bayes approach to efficient portfolio selection (1986) J Financ Quant Anal, 21, pp. 293-305; Jacod, J., Li, Y., Mykland, P.A., Podolskij, M., Vetter, M., Microstructure noise in the continuous case: the pre-averaging approach (2009) Stoch Process Appl, 119, pp. 2249-2276; Jagannathan, R., Ma, T., Risk reduction in large portfolios: why imposing the wrong constraints helps (2003) J Finance, 58, pp. 1651-1683; Klein, R.W., Bawa, V.S., The effect of estimation risk on optimal portfolio choice (1976) J Financ Econ, 3, pp. 215-231; Ledoit, O., Wolf, M., A well-conditioned estimator for large-dimensional covariance matrices (2004) J Multivar Anal, 88, pp. 365-411; Markowitz, H.M., Portfolio selection (1952) J Finance, 7, pp. 77-91; Markowitz, H.M., (1959) Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification of Investments, , New York: Wiley; Podolskij, M., Vetter, M., Estimation of volatility functionals in the simultaneous presence of microstructure noise and jumps (2009) Bernoulli, 15, pp. 634-658; Wang, Y., Zou, J., Vast volatility matrix estimation for high-frequency financial data (2010) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 943-978; Zhang, L., Efficient estimation of volatility using noisy observations (2006) Bernoulli, 12, pp. 1019-1043; Zhang, L., Estimating covariation: Epps effect and microstructure noise (2012) J Econom, 160, pp. 33-47; Zhang, L., Mykland, P.A., Ait-Sahalia, Y., A tale of two time scales: determining integrated volatility with noisy high-frequency data (2005) J Am Stat Assoc, 100, pp. 1394-1411",English,Article

We first introduce a method of eliciting univariate beta distributions for the probability of each category, conditional on the probabilities of other categories. Two different forms of multivariate prior are derived from the elicited beta distributions. First, we determine the hyperparameters of a Dirichlet distribution by reconciling the assessed parameters of the univariate beta conditional distributions. Although the Dirichlet distribution is the standard conjugate prior distribution for multinomial models, it is not flexible enough to represent a broad range of prior information. Second, we use the beta distributions to determine the parameters of a Connor-Mosimann distribution, which is a generalization of a Dirichlet distribution and is also a conjugate prior for multinomial models. It has a larger number of parameters than the standard Dirichlet distribution and hence a more flexible structure. The elicitation methods are designed to be used with the aid of interactive graphical user-friendly software. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Connor-Mosimann distribution; Dirichlet distribution; Elicitation method; Interactive graphical software; Multinomial model; Prior distribution,,"Aitchison, J., (1986) The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data, , London: Chapman and Hall; Albert, J.H., Gubta, A.K., Mixtures of Dirichlet distributions and estimation in contingency tables (1982) Ann Stat, 10, pp. 1261-1268; Bunn, D.W., Estimation of a Dirichlet prior distribution (1978) Omega, 6, pp. 371-373; Chaloner, K., Duncan, G.T., Some properties of the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and its use in prior elicitation (1987) Commun Stat, Theory Methods, 16, pp. 511-523; Connor, R.J., Mosimann, J.E., Concepts of independence for proportions with a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution (1969) J Am Stat Assoc, 64, pp. 194-206; Dickey, J.M., Jiang, J.M., Kadane, J.B., (1983) Bayesian methods for multinomial sampling with noninformatively missing data, , Technical report 6/83 - #15, State University of New Yourk at Albany, Department of Mathematics and Statistics; Fan, D.Y., The distribution of the product of independent beta variables (1991) Commun Stat, Theory Methods, 20, pp. 4043-4052; Garthwaite, P.H., Kadane, J.B., O'Hagan, A., Statistical methods for eliciting probability distributions (2005) J Am Stat Assoc, 100, pp. 680-701; Hankin, R.K.S., A generalization of the Dirichlet distribution (2010) J Stat Softw, 33, pp. 1-18; Hughes, G., Madden, L.V., Some methods for eliciting expert knowledge of plant disease epidemics and their application in cluster sampling for disease incidence (2002) Crop Prot, 21, pp. 203-215; Kadane, J.B., Wolfson, L.J., Experiences in elicitation (1998) Statistician, 47, pp. 3-19; Leonard, T., Bayesian estimation methods for two-way contingency tables (1975) J R Stat Soc B, 37, pp. 23-37; Lochner, R.H., A generalized Dirichlet distribution in Bayesian life testing (1975) J R Stat Soc B, 37, pp. 103-113; Oakley, J., Eliciting univariate probability distributions (2010) Rethinking Risk Measurement and Reporting: Vol I, , K.

We compute for the case of large electorates the exact level of unanimity above which the Anscombe's α-paradox never holds, whatever the distribution of individuals among votes. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Anscombe; Issue-wise voting; Majority rule; Unanimity; Voting paradox,,"Alcalde-Unzu, J., Vorsatz, M., Do we agree?

A distinguishing feature of the model is that the rates of the Poisson arrival process depends on the server state. For this model we investigate the stability conditions and the joint queue length distribution in steady state. We also prove that our model satisfies the stochastic decomposition property. Transient, as well as steady state solutions for reliability measures are obtained. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the typical features of the model under consideration. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Negative customers; Preemptive resume priority; Reliability; Retrial queue; Single vacation; State dependent arrivals; Stochastic decomposition; Unreliable server,,"Aissani, A., A retrial queue with redundancy and unreliable server (1994) Queueing Syst, 17, pp. 431-449; Aissani, A., Artalejo, J.R., On the single server retrial queue subject to breakdowns (1998) Queueing Syst, 30, pp. 309-321; Aguir, S., Karaesmen, F., Aksin, O., Chauvet, F., The impact of retrials on call centers performance (2004) OR Spektrum, 26, pp. 353-376; Anisimov, V., Artalejo, J.R., Analysis of Markov multiserver retrial queues with negative arrivals (2001) Queueing Syst, 39, pp. 157-182; Artalejo, J.R., A classified bibliography of research on retrial queues: progress in 1990-1999 (1999) Top, 7 (2), pp. 187-211; Artalejo, J.R., A classified bibliography of research on retrial queues: progress in 2000-2009 (2010) Math Comput Model, 51, pp. 1071-1081; Artalejo, J.R., Gomez-Corral, A., (2008) Retrial Queueing Systems, a Computational Approach, , Berlin: Springer; Artalejo, J.R., Gomez-Corral, A., Analysis of a stochastic clearing system with repeated attempts (1998) Stoch Models, 14, pp. 623-645; Artalejo, J.R., Gomez-Corral, A., Steady state solution of a single-server queue with linear requests repeated (1997) J Appl Probab, 34, pp. 223-233; Artalejo, J.R., Dudin, A.N., Klimenok, V.I., Stationary analysis of a retrial queue with preemptive repeated attempts (2001) Oper Res Lett, 28, pp. 173-180; Artalejo, J.R., Li, Q.-L., Performance analysis of a block-structured discrete-time retrial queue with state-dependent arrivals (2010) Discrete Event Dyn Syst, 20, pp. 325-347; Boon, M., van Wijk, A., Adan, I., Boxma, O., A polling model with smart customers (2010) Queueing Syst, 66 (3), pp. 239-274; Choi, B.D., Chang, Y., Single server retrial queues with priority customers (1999) Math Comput Model, 30, pp. 7-32; Cinlar, E., (1975) Introduction to Stochastic Processes, , New York: Prentice Hall; Dimitriou, I., Langaris, C., A repairable queueing model with two-phase service, start-up times and retrial customers (2010) Comput Oper Res, 37 (7), pp. 1181-1190; Falin, G.I., Artalejo, J.R., Martin, M., On the single server retrial queue with priority customers (1993) Queueing Syst, 14, pp. 439-455; Falin, G.I., Templeton, J.G.C., (1997) Retrial Queues, , London: Chapman and Hall; Furhmand, S.W., Cooper, R.B., Stochastic decompositions in the M/G/1 queue with generalized vacations (1985) Oper Res, 33 (5), pp. 1117-1129; Gomez-Corral, A., Ramalhoto, M.F., The stationary distribution of a Markovian process arising in the theory of multiserver retrial queueing systems (1999) Math Comput Model, 30, pp. 141-158; Koole, G., Mandelbaum, A., Queueing models of call centers, an introduction (2002) Ann Oper Res, 113, pp. 41-59; Kulkarni, V.G., Choi, B.D., Retrial queue with server subject to breakdowns and repairs (1990) Queueing Syst, 7 (2), pp. 191-208; Kulkarni, V.G., Liang, H.M., Retrial queues revisited (1997) Frontiers in Queueing, pp. 19-34. , J.

The collective value of a player is defined as the sum of the equal division of the pure surplus obtained by his coalition from the coalitional bargaining and of his Shapley value for the internal coalition. The weighted Shapley value applied to a game played by coalitions with coalition-size weights is assigned to each coalition, reflecting the size asymmetries among coalitions. We show that the collective value matches exogenous interpretations of coalition structures and provide an axiomatic foundation of this value. A noncooperative mechanism that implements the collective value is also presented. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Axiomatization; Coalition structure; Coalition-size weights; Implementation; Two-step Shapley value; Weighted Shapley value,,"Amer, R., Carreras, F., Cooperation indices and coalitional value (1995) Top, 3, pp. 117-135; Aumann, R.J., Dreze, J.H., Cooperative games with coalition structures (1974) Int J Game Theory, 3, pp. 217-237; Calvo, E., Lasaga, J.J., Winter, E., The principle of balanced contributions and hierarchies of cooperation (1996) Math Soc Sci, 31, pp. 171-182; Casajus, A., Outside options, component efficiency, and stability (2009) Games Econ Behav, 65, pp. 49-61; Gómez-Rúa, M., Vidal-Puga, J., Balanced per capita contributions and level structure of cooperation (2010) Top, , doi:10.1007/s11750-009-0122-3; Gómez-Rúa, M., Vidal-Puga, J., The axiomatic approach to three values in games with coalition structure (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 207, pp. 795-806; Hamiache, G., A value for games with coalition structures (2006) Soc Choice Welf, 26, pp. 93-105; Hart, S., Kurz, M., Endogenous formation of coalitions (1983) Econometrica, 51, pp. 1047-1064; Hart, S., Mas-Colell, A., Potential, value and consistency (1989) Econometrica, 57, pp. 589-614; Kalai, E., Nonsymmetric Nash solutions and replications of 2-person bargaining (1977) Int J Game Theory, 6, pp. 129-133; Kalai, E., Samet, D., On weighted Shapley values (1987) Int J Game Theory, 16, pp. 205-222; Kamijo, Y., Implementation of weighted values in hierarchical and horizontal cooperation structures (2008) Math Soc Sci, 56, pp. 336-349; Kamijo, Y., A two-step Shapley value for cooperative games with coalition structures (2009) Int Game Theory Rev, 11, pp. 207-214; Levy, A., McLean, R.P., Weighted coalition structure values (1989) Games Econ Behav, 1, pp. 234-249; Myerson, R.B., Graphs and cooperation in games (1977) Math Oper Res, 2, pp. 225-229; Myerson, R.B., Conference structures and fair allocation rules (1980) Int J Game Theory, 9, pp. 169-182; Owen, G., Values of games with a priori unions (1977) Essays in Mathematical Economics and Game Theory, pp. 76-88. , R.

Two integer linear optimization models for conflict avoidance between any number of aircraft in the airspace are proposed, the first being a pure 0-1 linear which avoids conflicts by means of altitude changes, and the second a mixed 0-1 linear whose strategy is based on altitude and speed changes. Several objective functions are established. Due to the small elapsed time that is required for solving both problems, the approach can be used in real time by using state-of-the-art mixed integer linear optimization software. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Air traffic flow management; Conflict avoidance; Conflict detection and resolution; Mixed 0-1 linear optimization; Pure 0-1 linear optimization,,"Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Martín-Campo, F.J., Collision avoidance in the ATM problem: a mixed integer linear optimization approach (2010) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 12, pp. 47-57; (1999) European air traffic forecast 1985-2015, , Air Traffic Action Group (ATAG), Geneva, Switzerland; Christodoulou, M.A., Costoulakis, C., Nonlinear mixed integer programming for aircraft collision avoidance in free flight (2004) IEEE Melecon, 1, pp. 327-330. , Dubrovnik (Croatia); Christodoulou, M.A., Kodaxakis, S.G., Automatic commercial aircraft-collision avoidance in free flight: the three-dimensional problem (2006) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 7 (2), pp. 242-249; Etkin, B., Reid, L.D., (1996) Dynamics of Flight: Stability and Control, , New York: Wiley; Hu, J., Prandini, M., Sastry, S., Optimal coordinated maneuvers for three dimensional aircraft conflict resolution (2002) AIAA J Guid Control Dyn, 25 (5), pp. 888-900; Hu, J., Prandini, M., Sastry, S., Optimal coordinated motions for multiple agents moving on a plane (2003) SIAM J Control Optim, 42 (2), pp. 637-668; Hu, J., Prandini, M., Sastry, S., Probabilistic safety analysis in three dimensional aircraft flight (2003) Proceedings of 42nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, 5, pp. 5335-5340; Hu, J., Prandini, M., Sastry, S., Aircraft conflict prediction in the presence of a spatially correlated wind field (2005) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 6 (3), pp. 326-340; Hull, D.G., (2007) Fundamentals of Airplane Flight Mechanics, , Berlin: Springer; (2009) User manual, , IBM ILOG COKEX; Jardin, M.R., Real-time conflict-free trajectory optimization (2003) Fifth USA/Europe Air Trafic Management RD Seminar, , Budapest (Hungary); Jardin, M.R., (2003) Toward real-time en route air traffic control optimization, , PhD thesis, Stanford University (California); Jardin, M.R., Grid-based strategic air traffic conflict detection (2005) AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference and Exhibition; Kuchar, J.K., Yang, L.C., A review of conflict detection and resolution modeling methods (2000) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 1, pp. 179-189; Magister, T., Conflict detection and resolution in the vicinity of the top of descent point (2002) Promet, 14 (6), pp. 269-275; Magister, T., Avoidance maneuvering in the vicinity of the top of descent (2004) J Aerosp Eng, 17 (4), pp. 176-181; Mao, Z.-H., Feron, E., Bilimoria, K., Stability and performance of intersecting aircraft flows under decentralized conflict avoidance rules (2001) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 2 (2), pp. 101-109; Mao, Z.H., Dugail, D., Feron, E., Bilimoria, K., Stability of intersecting aircraft flows using heading-change maneuvers for conflict avoidance (2005) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 6 (4), pp. 357-369; Pallottino, L., Feron, E., Bicchi, A., Conflict resolution problems for air traffic management systems solved with mixed integer programming (2002) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 3 (1), pp. 3-11; Pannequin, J.J., Bayen, A.M., Mitchell, I.M., Chung, H., Sastry, S., Multiple aircraft deconflicted path planning with weather avoidance constraints (2007) AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference, , Hilton Head (South Carolina, USA); Prandini, M., Hu, J., Application of reachability analysis for stochastic hybrid systems to aircraft conflict prediction (2008) IEEE Trans Autom Control; Richards, A.G., How, J.P., Aircraft trajectory planning with collision avoidance using mixed integer linear programming (2002) American Control Conference, , Anchorage (Alaska, USA); (1983) Minimum performance specifications for tcas airborne equipment, , Radio Technical Committee on Aeronautics RTCA, Document No RTCA/DO185, Washington DC, USA; Tewari, A., (2007) Atmospheric and Space Flight Dynamics: Modeling and Simulation with MATLAB and Simulink, , Basel: Birkhäuser; Treleaven, K., Mao, Z.H., Conflict resolution and traffic complexity of multiple intersecting flows of aircraft (2008) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 9 (4), pp. 633-643",English,Article

The conjecture itself has been disproved, but what we know about the underlying question is quite scarce. Most notably, no polynomial upper bound is known for the diameters that were conjectured to be linear. In contrast, no polyhedron violating the conjecture by more than 25 % is known. This paper reviews several recent attempts and progress on the question. Some work is in the world of polyhedra or (more often) bounded polytopes, but some try to shed light on the question by generalizing it to simplicial complexes. In particular, we include here our recent and previously unpublished proof that the maximum diameter of arbitrary simplicial complexes is in n Θ(d), and we summarize the main ideas in the polymath 3 project, a web-based collective effort trying to prove an upper bound of type nd for the diameters of polyhedra and of more general objects (including, e.g., simplicial manifolds). © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",diameter;

We extend previously suggested models by incorporating the variation in pipeline flow capacities with gas specific gravity and compressibility. Flow capacities are modeled as functions of pressure, compressibility and specific gravity by the commonly-used Weymouth equation, and the California Natural Gas Association method is used to model compressibility as a function of specific gravity and pressure. The sources feeding the transmission network do not necessarily supply gas with equal specific gravity. In our model, it is assumed that when different flow streams enter a junction point, the specific gravity of the resulting flow is a weighted average of the specific gravities of entering flows. We also assume the temperature to be constant, and the system to be in steady state. Since the proposed model is non-convex, and global optimization hence can be time consuming, we also propose a heuristic method based on an iterative scheme in which a simpler NLP model is solved in each iteration. Computational experiments are conducted in order to assess the computability of the model by applying a global optimizer, and to evaluate the performance of the heuristic approach. When applied to a wide set of test instances, the heuristic method provides solutions with deviations less than 10% from optimality, and in many instances turns out to be exact. We also report several experiments demonstrating that letting the compressibility and the specific gravity be global constants can lead to significant errors in the estimates of the total network capacity. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",CNGA method; Compressibility factor; Natural gas; Nonlinear optimization; Specific gravity; Transmission network; Weymouth equation,,"Abbaspour, M., Chapman, K.S., Nonisothermal transient flow in natural gas pipeline (2008) J Appl Mech, 75 (3), pp. 181-188. , doi:10.1115/1.2840046; Bakhouya, B., De Wolf, D., (2007) The gas transmission problem when the merchant and the transport functions are disconnected, , HEC Ecole de Gestion de l'Université de Liége (ULG), Working paper 2007 01/01; Borraz-Sánchez, C., Haugland, D., A tree decomposition algorithm for minimizing fuel cost in gas transmission networks (2009) Proceedings of the 39th International Conference: Computers & Industrial Engineering (cie2009), pp. 244-249. , 978-1-4244-4135-8; Borraz-Sánchez, C., Ríos-Mercado, R.Z., A non-sequential dynamic programming approach for natural gas network optimization (2004) WSEAS Trans Syst, 3 (4), pp. 1384-1389; Borraz-Sánchez, C., Ríos-Mercado, R.Z., Improving the operation of pipeline systems on cyclic structures by tabu search (2009) Comput Chem Eng, 33 (1), pp. 58-64; Carter, R.G., Pipeline optimization: dynamic programming after 30 years (1998) Proceedings of the 30th PSIG Annual Meeting, , Denver, CO, USA; Chaczykowski, M., Transient flow in natural gas pipeline-the effect of pipeline thermal model (2010) Appl Math Model, 34, pp. 1051-1067; (1982) Flow of fluids through valves, fittings and pipe, , Crane Co, Technical paper 410, Metric Edition, USA; Davisson, E.G., (1965) A computer program for flow calculations, , Tech report ORNL-TM-1093, OAK Ridge National Laboratory, US Atomic Energy Commission, USA; De Wolf, D., Smeers, Y., (1994) Mathematical properties of formulations of the gas transmission problem, , SMG preprint 94/12.

With this in mind, several proposals have been introduced in the literature. The TCLUST procedure works with a restriction on the ""eigenvalues-ratio"" of the clusters scatter matrices. In order to try to achieve robustness with respect to outliers, the procedure allows to trim off a proportion α of the most outlying observations. The resistance to infinitesimal contamination of the TCLUST has already been studied. This paper aims to look at its resistance to a higher amount of contamination by means of the study of its breakdown behavior. The rather new concept of restricted breakdown point will demonstrate that the TCLUST procedure resists to a proportion α of contamination as soon as the data set is sufficiently ""well clustered"". © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Breakdown point; Clustering; Robustness; TCLUST; Trimming,,"Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Gordaliza, A., Matrán, C., Trimmed k-means: an attempt to robustify quantizers (1997) Ann Stat, 25, pp. 553-576; Dennis Jr., J.E., Algorithms for nonlinear fitting (1982) Nonlinear Optimization, pp. 67-78. , Cambridge1981, London: Academic Press; Donoho, D., Huber, P.J., The notion of breakdown point (1983) A Festschrift for Erich L.

The proposed reweighted least trimmed squares (RLTS) estimator employs data-dependent weights determined from an initial robust fit. Just like many existing one- and two-step robust methods, the RLTS estimator preserves robust properties of the initial robust estimate. However contrary to existing methods, the first-order asymptotic behavior of RLTS is independent of the initial estimate even if errors exhibit heteroscedasticity, asymmetry, or serial correlation. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic distribution of RLTS and show that it is asymptotically efficient for normally distributed errors. A simulation study documents benefits of these theoretical properties in finite samples. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic efficiency; Breakdown point; Least trimmed squares; Linear regression,,"Aquaro, M., Čížek, P., (2010) Two-step robust estimation of fixed-effects panel data models, , CentER discussion paper, Tilburg University; Balke, N.S., Fomby, T.B., Large shocks, small shocks, and economic fluctuations: outliers in macroeconomic time series (1994) J Appl Econom, 9, pp. 181-200; Baltagi, B.H., Jung, B.C., Song, S.H., Testing for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation in a random effects panel data model (2010) J Econom, 154, pp. 122-124; Chen, L.-A., Chiang, Y.-C., Symmetric quantile and symmetric trimmed mean for linear regression model (1996) J Nonparametr Stat, 7, pp. 171-185; Čížek, P., Least trimmed squares under dependence (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 3967-3988; Čížek, P., General trimmed estimation: robust approach to nonlinear and limited dependent variable models (2008) Econom Theory, 24, pp. 1500-1529; Čížek, P., (2010) Reweighted least trimmed squares: An alternative to one-step estimators, , CentER discussion paper 2010/91, Tilburg University, The Netherlands; Čížek, P., Efficient robust estimation of regression models (2011) Comput Stat Data Anal, 55, pp. 774-788; Davidson, J., (1994) Stochastic Limit Theory, , New York: Oxford University Press; Davies, P.L., Gather, U., Breakdown and groups (2005) Ann Stat, 33, pp. 977-1035; De Long, J.B., Summers, L.H., Equipment investment and economic growth (1991) Q J Econ, 106, pp. 445-501; Engler, E., Nielsen, B., The empirical process of autoregressive residuals (2009) Econom J, 12 (2), pp. 367-381; Genton, M.G., Lucas, A., Comprehensive definitions of breakdown points for independent and dependent observations (2003) J R Stat Soc, Ser B, 65, pp. 81-94; Gervini, D., Yohai, V.J., A class of robust and fully efficient regression estimators (2002) Ann Stat, 30, pp. 583-616; Hampel, F.R., Ronchetti, E.M., Rousseeuw, P.J., Stahel, W.A., (1986) Robust Statistics: The Approach Based on Influence Function, , New York: Wiley; He, X., Portnoy, S., Reweighted LS estimators converge at the same rate as the initial estimator (1992) Ann Stat, 20, pp. 2161-2167; Koenker, R.W., Bassett, G., Regression quantiles (1978) Econometrica, 46, pp. 33-50; Marazzi, A., Yohai, V.J., Adaptively truncated maximum likelihood regression with asymmetric errors (2004) J Stat Plan Inference, 122, pp. 271-291; Preminger, A., Franck, R., Foreign exchange rates: a robust regression approach (2007) Int J Forecast, 23, pp. 71-84; Ronchetti, E., Trojani, F., Robust inference with GMM estimators (2001) J Econom, 101, pp. 37-69; Rousseeuw, P.J., Least median of squares regression (1984) J Am Stat Assoc, 79, pp. 871-880; Rousseeuw, P.J., Multivariate estimation with high breakdown point (1985) Mathematical Statistics and Applications, B, pp. 283-297. , W.

As already theoretically pointed out by Fernholz (in J. Stat. Plan. Inference 57(1), 29-38, 1997), smoothing the empirical distribution function with an appropriate kernel and bandwidth can reduce the variance and mean squared error (MSE) of some quantile-based estimators in small data sets. In this paper we apply this idea on several robust estimators of location, scale and skewness. We propose a robust bandwidth selection and bias reduction procedure. We show that the use of this smoothing method indeed leads to smaller MSEs, also at contaminated data sets. In particular, we obtain better performances for the medcouple which is a robust measure of skewness that can be used for outlier detection in skewed distributions. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Adjusted boxplot; Kernel smoothing; Medcouple; Quantile based estimators; Robust bandwidth selection,,"Azzalini, A., A note on the estimation of a distribution function and quantiles by a kernel method (1981) Biometrika, 68, pp. 326-328; Bowman, A.W., Hall, P., Prvan, T., Bandwidth selection for the smoothing of distribution functions (1998) Biometrika, 85, pp. 799-808; Brys, G., Hubert, M., Struyf, A., A comparison of some new measures of skewness (2003) Developments in Robust Statistics: International Conference on Robust Statistics 2001, 114, pp. 98-113. , R.

The procedure provides an alternative to the standard likelihood ratio tests for evaluating null hypotheses concerning the correlation structure of repeated measurements. PLR tests are specifically designed for nonstandard test situations where non-identifiability of a nuisance parameter occurs under the null hypothesis. The idea is to penalize the estimation close to the boundary of the domain of the nuisance parameter and thereby eliminate the non-identifiability. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test is a 50:50 mixture of chi-square distributions with 0 and 1 degrees of freedom. Simulation studies indicate that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test provides a good approximation, even for fairly small data sets (10-20 subjects). A sensitivity analysis with a real data example highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the test procedure. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Autoregressive covariance structure; Locally most powerful test; Mixtures of χ2 distributions; Nonstandard regularity conditions,,"Chen, H., Chen, J., Kalbfleisch, J.D., A modified likelihood ratio test for homogeneity in finite mixture models (2001) J R Stat Soc B, 63, pp. 19-29; Chen, H., Chen, J., Kalbfleisch, J.D., Testing for a finite mixture model with two components (2004) J R Stat Soc B, 66, pp. 95-115; Chen, J., Penalized likelihood-ratio test for finite mixture models with multinomial observations (1998) Can J Stat, 26, pp. 583-599; Chen, Y., Liang, K.Y., On the asymptotic behaviour of the pseudolikelihood ratio test statistic with boundary problems (2010) Biometrika, 97, pp. 603-620; Crainiceanu, C.M., Ruppert, D., Likelihood ratio tests in linear mixed models with one variance component (2004) J R Stat Soc B, 66, pp. 165-185; Di, C.Z., Liang, K.Y., Likelihood ratio testing for admixture models with application to genetic linkage analysis (2011) Biometrics, 67, pp. 1249-1259; Diggle, P.J., An approach to the analysis of repeated measurements (1988) Biometrics, 44, pp. 959-971; Fitzmaurice, G.M., Laird, N.M., Ware, J.H., (2011) Applied Longitudinal Analysis, , 2nd edn., Hoboken: Wiley; Haskard, K.A., Cullis, B.R., Verbyla, A.P., Anisotropic Matérn correlation and spatial prediction using REML (2007) J Agric Biol Environ Stat, 12, pp. 1-14; Jennrich, R.I., Schluchter, M.D., Unbalanced repeated-measures models with structured covariance matrices (1986) Biometrics, 42, pp. 805-820; Lark, R.M., Kriging a soil variable with a simple nonstationary variance model (2009) J Agric Biol Environ Stat, 14, pp. 301-321; Lauritzen, S.L., Goodness of fit-with a view towards particle physics (2005) PHYSTAT 05, Statistical Problems in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology, , L.

Assuming an i.i.d. sample of (Y,Z 1,...,ZL) of size n we propose an estimator of the slope which is based on a dimension reduction technique and additional thresholding. We derive in terms of both the sample size n and the panel size L a lower bound of a maximal weighted risk over a certain ellipsoid of slope functions and a certain class of covariance operators associated with the regressor X. It is shown that the proposed estimator attains this lower bound up to a constant and hence it is minimax-optimal. The results are illustrated considering different configurations which cover in particular the estimation of the slope as well as its derivatives. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Linear Galerkin approach; Linear inverse problem; Minimax-optimal estimation; Sobolev space,,"Bereswill, M., (2009) Minimax-optimal estimation in functional linear model with noisy regressor, , Master's thesis, Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg; Bosq, D., (2000) Linear Processes in Function Spaces, 149. , Lecture notes in statistics, Berlin: Springer; Cardot, H., Johannes, J., Thresholding projection estimators in functional linear models (2010) J Multivar Anal, 101 (2), pp. 395-408; Cardot, H., Ferraty, F., Sarda, P., Functional linear model (1999) Stat Probab Lett, 45 (1), pp. 11-22; Cardot, H., Ferraty, F., Sarda, P., Spline estimators for the functional linear model (2003) Stat Sin, 13, pp. 571-591; Cardot, H., Mas, A., Sarda, P., CLT in functional linear regression models (2007) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 138 (3-4), pp. 325-361; Crambes, C., Kneip, A., Sarda, P., Smoothing splines estimators for functional linear regression (2009) Ann Stat, 37 (1), pp. 35-72; Dahlhaus, R., Polonik, W., Nonparametric quasi-maximum likelihood estimation for Gaussian locally stationary processes (2006) Ann Stat, 34 (6), pp. 2790-2824; Davidson, K.R., Szarek, S.J., Local operator theory, random matrices and Banach spaces (2001) Handbook on the Geometry of Banach Spaces, 1, pp. 317-366. , W.

For example, Rodriguez-Poo et al. (A practical test for misspecification in regression: functional form, separability, and distribution. Econom. Theory, 2013, under revision) considered optimal rates of adaptive nonparametric tests when the null model is semiparametric. A second, though related question is, how serious are the bandwidth and calibration problems? Sperlich (On the choice of regularization parameters in specification testing: a critical discussion. Empir. Econ., 2013, forthcoming) has shown that the unsolved bandwidth selection problems, in particular when calibrating, render nonparametric specification tests useless in practice. Two additional questions are only raised briefly and concern (a) the computational aspects, and (b) the problem that asymptotically, nonparametric omnibus tests might reject almost any null hypothesis as probably no parametric or semiparametric model is 100 % correct. But it is maybe a reasonable and useful approximation. To this aim we recall the idea of testing the problem of so-called 'precise hypotheses' as outlined in Dette (Ann. Stat. 27:1012-1040, 1999) for nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bandwidth selection; Bootstrap tests; Non- and semiparametric testing; Precise hypotheses;

Unlike the classic discounted models, we allow a non-constant discount factor. After defining and characterizing the corresponding occupation measures, the original constrained DTMDP is written as a convex program in the space of occupation measures, whose compactness and convexity we show. In particular, we prove that every extreme point of the space of occupation measures can be generated by a deterministic stationary policy for the DTMDP. For the resulting convex program, we prove that it admits a solution that can be expressed as a convex combination of N+1 extreme points of the space of occupation measures. One of its consequences is the existence of a randomized stationary optimal policy for the original constrained DTMDP. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Convex analytic approach; Markov decision processes; Occupation measure,,"Aliprantis, C., Border, K., (2007) Infinite Dimensional Analysis, , New York: Springer; Altman, E., (1999) Constrained Markov Decision Processes, , Boca Raton: Chapman & Hall/CRC; Bertsekas, D., Shreve, S., (1978) Stochastic Optimal Control, , New York: Academic Press; Borkar, V., A convex analytic approach to Markov decision processes (1988) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 78, pp. 583-602; Chen, R., Blankenship, G., Dynamic programming equations for discounted constrained stochastic control (2004) IEEE Trans Autom Control, 49, pp. 699-709; Dynkin, E., Yushkevich, A., (1979) Controlled Markov Processes, , New York: Springer; Frid, E., On optimal strategies in control problems with constraints (1972) Theory Probab Appl, 17, pp. 188-192; González-Hernández, J., Hernández-Lerma, O., Extreme points of sets of randomized strategies in constrained optimization and control problems (2005) SIAM J Optim, 15, pp. 1085-1104; González-Hernández, J., López-Martińez, R., Pérez-Hernández, J., Markov control processes with randomized discounted cost (2007) Math Methods Oper Res, 65, pp. 27-44; González-Hernández, J., López-Martińez, R., Minjárez-Sosa, J., Approximation, estimation and control of stochastic systems under a randomized discounted cost criterion (2009) Kybernetika, 45, pp. 737-754; Guo, X., Piunovskiy, A., Discounted continuous-time Markov decision processes with constraints: unbounded transition and loss rates (2011) Math Oper Res, 36, pp. 105-132; Hernández-Lerma, O., Lasserre, J., (1996) Discrete-Time Markov Control Processes, , New York: Springer; Hernández-Lerma, O., Lasserre, J., (1999) Further Topics on Discrete-Time Markov Control Processes, , New York: Springer; Hernández-Lerma, O., González-Hernández, J., Constrained Markov control processes in Borel spaces: the discounted case (2000) Math Methods Oper Res, 52, pp. 271-285; Mao, X., Piunovskiy, A., Strategic measures in optimal control problems for stochastic sequences (2000) Stoch Anal Appl, 18, pp. 755-776; Meyer, P., (1966) Probability and Potentials, , Waltham: Blaisdell; Piunovskiy, A., (1997) Optimal Control of Random Sequences in Problems with Constraints, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Piunovskiy, A., Controlled random sequences: the convex analytic approach and constrained problems (2000) Russ Math Surv, 53, pp. 1233-1293; Piunovskiy, A., Dynamic programming in constrained Markov decision processes (2006) Control Cybern, 35, pp. 645-660; Piunovskiy, A., Mao, X., Constrained Markovian decision processes: the dynamic programming approach (2000) Oper Res Lett, 27, pp. 119-126; Prokhorov, Y., Convergence of random processes and limit theorems in probability theory (1956) Theory Probab Appl, 1, pp. 157-214; Rockafellar, R., (1974) Conjugate Duality and Optimization, , Philadelphia: SIAM; Schäll, M., Conditions for optimality in dynamic programming and for the limit of n-stage optimal policies to be optimal (1975) Z Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor Verw Geb, 32, pp. 179-196; Varadarajan, V., Weak convergence of measures on separable metric spaces (1958) Sankhya, 19, pp. 15-22",English,Article

The finance theory has adopted the wealth maximization principle, focusing on normative and descriptive approaches often highlighting multiple factors that drive this single goal. Multicriteria decision systems add important practical contributions in this context, supporting financial decision makers in modeling, analyzing, and evaluating multiple ways of action, under all decision criteria pertinent in a specific decision instance. This paper analyzes the relevance of multicriteria decision systems for financial decisions. A detailed discussion and up-to-date review on two important areas of financial decision support, namely portfolio selection and corporate performance evaluation, are also given to highlight how different multicriteria modeling approaches complement and enhance exiting techniques from the areas of finance and operations research. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Decision support; Financial decision making; Multicriteria decision aid,,"Abdou, H.A., Pointon, J., Credit scoring, statistical techniques and evaluation criteria: a review of the literature (2011) Intell Syst Account Finance Manag, 18 (2-3), pp. 59-88; Aebi, V., Sabato, G., Schmid, M., Risk management, corporate governance, and bank performance in the financial crisis (2012) J Bank Finance, 36 (12), pp. 3213-3226; Arrow, K.J., Raynaud, H., (1986) Social Choice and Multicriterion Decision-Making, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Artzner, P., Delbaen, F., Eber, J.M., Heath, D., Coherent measures of risk (1999) Math Finance, 9 (3), pp. 203-228; Azmi, R., Tamiz, M., A review of goal programming for portfolio selection (2010) New Developments in Multiple Objective and Goal Programming, 638, pp. 15-33. , Lecture notes in economics and mathematical systems, D.

The purpose of the extensions is to reduce computation time during the fix-and-relax process and to improve solution quality after a first solution is found. The feature which improves solution quality is independent of the method used for calculating the first solution. In this study, the algorithm and extensions have been tested on four liquefied natural gas (LNG) cases and the impacts on computational time and objective function value are reported. The results show that using fix-and-relax reduces computing time considerably while the objective function value is only slightly worse compared to a general MILP solver. Furthermore, the results confirm that the extensions work according to the intentions when compared to the original fix-and-relax heuristic. For relatively complex cases, it appears advantageous to use the extensions developed. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Fix-and-relax; Liquefied natural gas (LNG); Maritime inventory routing problem (IRP); Time decomposition heuristic,,"Absi, N., Kedad-Sidhoum, S., MIP-based heuristics for multi-item capacitated lot-sizing problem with setup times and shortage costs (2007) RAIRO Oper Res, 41, pp. 171-192; Akartunali, K., Miller, A., A heuristic approach for big bucket multi-level production planning problems (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 193, pp. 396-411; Al-Ameri, T.A., Shah, N., Papageorgiou, L.G., Optimization of vendor-managed inventory systems in a rolling horizon framework (2008) Comput Ind Eng, 54, pp. 1019-1047; Al-Khayal, F., Hwang, S.J., Inventory constrained maritime routing and scheduling for multi-commodity liquid bulk, part I: applications and model (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 176, pp. 106-130; Alonso, A., Escudero, L.F., Ortuno, M.T., A stochastic 0-1 program based approach for the air traffic flow management problem (2000) Eur J Oper Res, 120, pp. 47-62; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Pizarro, C., On SIP algorithms for minimizing the mean-risk function in the multi-period single-source problem under uncertainty (2009) Ann Oper Res, 166, pp. 223-242; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Pizarro, C., Romeijn, H.E., Romero Morales, D., On solving the multi-period single-sourcing problem under uncertainty (2006) Comput Manag Sci, 3, pp. 29-53; Andersson, H., Hoff, A., Christiansen, M., Hasle, G., Løkketangen, A., Industrial aspects and literature survey: combined inventory management and routing (2010) Comput Oper Res, 37, pp. 1515-1536; Appelgren, L.H., A column generation algorithm for a ship scheduling problem (1969) Transp Sci, 3, pp. 53-68; Appelgren, L.H., Integer programming methods for a vessel scheduling problem (1971) Transp Sci, 5, pp. 64-78; Aytekin, M., Applying a fix-and-relax heuristic to U.

The RTVP arises whenever products, clients or jobs need to be sequenced in such a way that the variability in the time between the points at which they receive the necessary resources is minimised. Since the RTVP is NP-hard, several heuristic and metaheuristic techniques are needed to solve non-small instances. The published metaheuristic procedure that obtained the best solutions, on average, for non-small RTVP instances is an algorithm based on a variant of the variable neighbourhood search (VNS), called Reduced VNS (RVNS). We propose hybridising RVNS with three existing algorithms based on tabu search, multi-start and particle swarm optimisation. The aim is to combine the strengths of the metaheuristics. A computational experiment is carried out and it is shown that, on average, all proposed hybrid methods are able to improve the best published solutions. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Fair sequences;

It is assumed that there is some dependent censoring acting on the variable of interest that may come from an existing competing risk. Furthermore, the full process is independently censored by some administrative censoring time. The dependent censoring is modeled through an Archimedean copula function, which is supposed to be known. An asymptotic representation of the estimator as a sum of independent and identically distributed random variables is obtained, and, consequently, a central limit theorem is established. We investigate the finite sample performance of the estimator through simulations.

A basic principle of model-free prediction is laid out based on the notion of transforming a given setup into one that is easier to work with, namely i.i.d. or Gaussian. As an application, the problem of nonparametric regression is addressed in detail; the model-free predictors are worked out, and shown to be applicable under minimal assumptions. Interestingly, model-free prediction in regression is a totally automatic technique that does not necessitate the search for an optimal data transformation before model fitting. The resulting model-free predictive distributions and intervals are compared to their corresponding model-based analogs, and the use of cross-validation is extensively discussed. As an aside, improved prediction intervals in linear regression are also obtained. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bootstrap; Cross-validation; Frequentist prediction; Heteroskedasticity; Nonparametric estimation; Prediction intervals; Regression; Smoothing; Transformations,,"Altman, N.S., An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression (1992) Am Stat, 46 (3), pp. 175-185; Atkinson, A.C., (1985) Plots, Transformations and Regression, , Oxford: Clarendon; Beran, R., Calibrating prediction regions (1990) J Am Stat Assoc, 85, pp. 715-723; Bickel, P., Li, B., Regularization in statistics (2006) Test, 15 (2), pp. 271-344; Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An analysis of transformations (1964) J R Stat Soc, Ser B, Stat Methodol, 26, pp. 211-252; Breiman, L., Friedman, J., Estimating optimal transformations for multiple regression and correlation (1985) J Am Stat Assoc, 80, pp. 580-597; Carmack, P.S., Schucany, W.R., Spence, J.S., Gunst, R.F., Lin, Q., Haley, R.W., Far casting cross-validation (2009) J Comput Graph Stat, 18 (4), pp. 879-893; Carroll, R.J., Ruppert, D., (1988) Transformations and Weighting in Regression, , New York: Chapman & Hall; Carroll, R.J., Ruppert, D., Prediction and tolerance intervals with transformation and/or weighting (1991) Technometrics, 33, pp. 197-210; Cox, D.R., Prediction intervals and empirical Bayes confidence intervals (1975) Perspectives in Probability and Statistics, pp. 47-55. , J.

Specifically, combining Politis' prediction method with procedures from Lombardía and Sperlich (Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 56:2903-2917, 2012) and González-Manteiga et al. (J. Multivar. Anal. 114:288-302, 2013) yields new MEM-based MF/MB point and interval predictors which can be used for example for small area statistics. Combining Politis' idea with nonparametric matching estimators may also yield improved (point and interval) estimators for treatment effects and policy evaluation. © 2013 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Non- and semiparametric estimation; Prediction; Small area statistics; Treatment effect estimation,,"Abadie, A., Imbens, G., Large sample properties of matching estimators for average treatment effects (2006) Econometrica, 74, pp. 235-267; Abadie, A., Imbens, G., On the failure of the bootstrap for matching estimators (2008) Econometrica, 76, pp. 1537-1557; Claeskens, G., Hjort, N.L., (2008) Model Selection and Model Averaging, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Elbers, C., Lanjouw, J.O., Lanjouw, P., Micro-level estimation of poverty and inequality (2003) Econometrica, 71, pp. 355-364; González-Manteiga, W., Martínez-Miranda, M.D., Lombardía-Cortiña, M.J., Sperlich, S., Kernel smoothers and bootstrapping for semiparametric mixed effects models (2013) J Multivar Anal, 114, pp. 288-302; Jiang, J., Lahiri, P., Mixed model prediction and small area estimation (2006) Test, 15, pp. 1-96. , with discussion; Köhler, M., Schindler, A., Sperlich, S., A review and comparison of bandwidth selection methods for kernel regression (2013) Int Stat Rev, , (conditionally accepted); Linhart, H., Zucchini, W., (1986) Model Selection, , New York: Wiley; Lombardía, M.J., Sperlich, S., Semiparametric inference in generalized mixed effects models (2008) J R Stat Soc B, 70, pp. 913-930; Lombardía, M.J., Sperlich, S., A new class of semi-mixed effects models and its application in small area estimation (2012) Comput Stat Data Anal, 56, pp. 2903-2917; Nielsen, J.P., Sperlich, S., Prediction of stocks: a new way to look at it (2003) ASTIN Bull, 33, pp. 399-417; Opsomer, J., Claeskens, G., Ranalli, M.G., Kauermann, G., Breidt, F.J., Non-parametric small area estimation using penalized spline regression (2008) J R Stat Soc B, 70, pp. 265-286; Politis, D.N., Model-free model-fitting and predictive distributions (2013) Test, , doi:10.1007/s11749-013-0317-7; Politis, D.N., Romano, J.P., Wolf, M., (1999) Subsampling, , New York: Springer; Rao, J.N.K., (2003) Small Area Estimation, , New York: Wiley; Salvati, N., Chadra, H., Ranalli, M.G., Chambers, R., Small area estimation using a nonparametric model-based direct estimator (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 2159-2171; Sperlich, S., On the choice of regularization parameters in specification testing: a critical discussion (2013) Empir Econ, , (forthcoming); Sperlich, S., Lombardía, M.J., Local polynomial inference for small area statistics: estimation, validation and prediction (2010) J Nonparametr Stat, 22, pp. 633-648; Verbeke, G., Molenberghs, G., (2000) Linear Mixed Models for Longitudinal Data, , New York: Springer; Wand, M.P., Smoothing and mixed models (2003) Comput Stat, 18, pp. 223-249",English,Article

The functional parameter estimated by functional principal component logit regression is often nonsmooth and then difficult to interpret. To solve this problem, different penalized spline estimations of the functional logit model are proposed in this paper. All of them are based on smoothed functional PCA and/or a discrete penalty in the log-likelihood criterion in terms of B-spline expansions of the sample curves and the functional parameter. The ability of these smoothing approaches to provide an accurate estimation of the functional parameter and their classification performance with respect to unpenalized functional PCA and LDA-PLS are evaluated via simulation and application to real data. Leave-one-out cross-validation and generalized cross-validation are adapted to select the smoothing parameter and the number of principal components or basis functions associated with the considered approaches. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",B-splines; Functional logit regression; Functional principal components analysis; Penalized splines,,"Agresti, A., (1990) Categorical Data Analysis, , New York: Wiley; Aguilera, A., Escabias, M., Preda, C., Saporta, G., Using basis expansion for estimating functional pls regression.

Following the Projection Pursuit Regression principle, we derive an additive decomposition which exploits the most interesting projections of the prediction variable to explain the response. On one hand, this approach allows us to avoid the well-known curse of dimensionality problem, and, on the other one, it can be used as an exploratory tool for the analysis of functional dataset. The terms of such decomposition are estimated with a procedure that combines a spline approximation and the one-dimensional Nadaraya-Watson approach. The good behavior of our procedure is illustrated from theoretical and practical points of view. Asymptotic results state that the terms in the additive decomposition can be estimated without suffering from the dimensionality problem, while some applications to real and simulated data show the high predictive performance of our method. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Additive decomposition; Consistency; Functional predictor; Functional regression; Predictive directions; Projection pursuit regression,,"Ait-Saidi, A., Ferraty, F., Kassa, R., Vieu, P., Cross-validated estimation in the single-functional index model (2008) Statistics, 42, pp. 475-494; Amato, U., Antoniadis, A., De Feis, I., Dimension reduction in functional regression with application (2006) Comput Stat Data Anal, 50, pp. 2422-2446; Aneiros-Pérez, G., Vieu, P., Semi-functional partial linear regression (2006) Stat Probab Lett, 76, pp. 1102-1110; Burnham, K.P., Anderson, D.R., (2002) Model Selection and Multimodel Inference, , 2nd edn., Berlin: Springer; Cardot, H., Sarda, P., Estimation in generalized linear models for functional data via penalized likelihood (2005) J Multivar Anal, 92, pp. 24-41; Cardot, H., Ferraty, F., Sarda, P., Functional linear model (1999) Stat Probab Lett, 45, pp. 11-22; Cardot, H., Ferraty, F., Sarda, P., Spline estimators for the functional linear model (2003) Stat Sin, 13, pp. 571-591; Cardot, H., Mas, A., Sarda, P., CLT in functional linear regression models (2007) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 138, pp. 325-361; Chen, H., Estimation of a projection-pursuit type regression model (1991) Ann Stat, 19, pp. 142-157; Crambes, C., Kneip, A., Sarda, P., Smoothing splines estimators for functional linear regression (2009) Ann Stat, 37, pp. 35-72; De Boor, C., (2001) A Practical Guide to Splines, , Series in probability and statistics, Berlin: Springer; Eilers, P.H.C., Li, B., Marx, B.D., Multivariate calibration with single-index signal regression (2009) Chemom Intell Lab, 96, pp. 196-202; Fan, J., Gijbels, I., Local polynomial fitting (2000) Smoothing and Regression.

This suggests the use of stochastic processes whose covariance structure is a function of the mean. Covariance functions must be positive definite. This fact is nontrivial in this context and constitutes one of the challenges of the present paper. We show that there exists a huge class of functions that, composed with the mean of the process in some way, preserves positive definiteness and can be used for the purposes of modeling and computing optimal designs in more realistic situations. We offer some examples for an easy construction of such covariances and then study the problem of locally D-optimal designs through an illustrative example as well as a real radiation retention model in the human body. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Compartmental Models;

Within this broad context, in this article we review a collection of global optimization problems coded in Mathematica, and present illustrative and summarized numerical results obtained using the MathOptimizer Professional software package. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Lipschitz Global Optimizer (LGO) solver suite for nonlinear optimization; MathOptimizer Professional; Model library in Mathematica; Nonlinear optimization in integrated technical computing environments; Optimization software benchmarking,,"Addis, B., Locatelli, M., A new class of test functions for global optimization (2007) J Glob Optim, 38, pp. 479-501; Addis, B., Locatelli, M., Schoen, F., Efficiently packing unequal disks in a circle (2008) Oper Res Lett, 36 (1), pp. 37-42; Ali, M.M., Khompatraporn, C., Zabinsky, Z.B., A numerical evaluation of several global optimization algorithms on selected test problems (2005) J Glob Optim, 31, pp. 635-672; (2011), www.ampl.com, AMPL LLC, AMPLAverick, B.M., Moré, J.J., (1991) The Minpack-2 test problem collection, , Technical report ANL/MCS-TM-157, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL; Barr, R.S., Golden, B.L., Kelly, J.P., Resende, M.G.C., Stewart, W.R., Designing and reporting on computational experiments with heuristic methods (1995) J Heuristics, 1, pp. 9-32; Berna, T.J., Locke, M.H., Westerberg, A.W., A new approach to optimization of chemical processes (1980) AIChE J, 26 (1), pp. 37-43; Bhatti, A.M., (2000) Practical Optimization Methods with Mathematica Applications, , New York: Springer; Bongartz, I., Conn, A.R., Gould, N.I.M., Toint, P.L., CUTE: constrained and unconstrained testing environment (1995) ACM Trans Math Softw, 21 (1), pp. 123-160; Buckley, A.G., Algorithm 709: testing algorithm implementations (1992) ACM Trans Math Softw, 18 (4), pp. 375-391; Casado, L.C., García, I., Martínez, J.A., Sergeyev, Y.D., New interval analysis support functions using gradient information in a global minimization algorithm (2003) J Glob Optim, 25, pp. 345-362; Castillo, I., Kampas, F.J., Pintér, J.D., Solving circle packing problems by global optimization: numerical results and industrial applications (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 191, pp. 786-802; Csendes, T., Pál, L., Sendin, O.H., Banga, J.R., The GLOBAL optimization method revisited (2008) Optim Lett, 2, pp. 445-454; Dimmer, P.R., Cutteridge, O.P.D., Second derivative Gauss-Newton-based method for solving nonlinear simultaneous equations (1980) IEE Proc G, Electron Circuits Syst, 127, pp. 278-283; Dixon, L., Szegö, G., (1975) Towards Global Optimisation, 1. , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Dixon, L., Szegö, G., (1978) Towards Global Optimisation, 2. , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Dolan, E.D., Moré, J.J., Benchmarking optimization software with performance profiles (2002) Math Program, Ser A, 91, pp. 201-213; Dolan, E.D., Moré, J.J., Munson, T.S., (2004) Benchmarking optimization software with COPS 3. 0, , Technical report ANL/MCS-TM-273, Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL; Doye, J.P.K., Leary, R.H., Locatelli, M., Schoen, F., The global optimization of Morse clusters by potential energy transformations (2004) INFORMS J Comput, 16, pp. 371-379; Ebers, J.J., Moll, J.L., Large signal behaviour of junction transistors (1954) Proc IRE, 42, pp. 1761-1772; Fasano, G., MIP-based heuristic for non-standard 3D-packing problems (2008) 4or, 6, pp. 291-310; Fasano, G., Saia, D., Piras, A., Columbus stowage optimization by CAST (Cargo Accommodation Support Tool) (2010) Acta Astronaut, 67 (3), pp. 489-496; Floudas, C.A., Pardalos, P.M., Adjiman, C.S., Esposito, W.R., Gümüş, Z.H., Harding, S.T., Klepeis, J.L., Schweiger, C.A., (1999) Handbook of Test Problems in Local and Global Optimization, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; (2011), www.gams.com, GAMS Development Corporation, GAMS(2011) GLOBAL Library: A collection of nonlinear programming models, , www.gamsworld.org/global/globallib.htm, GAMS Global World; (2011), www.gamsworld.org/performance/index.htm, GAMS Performance WorldGaviano, M., Kvasov, D.E., Lera, D., Sergeyev, Y.D., Algorithm 829: software for generation of classes of test functions with known local and global minima for global optimization (2003) ACM Trans Math Softw, 29 (4), pp. 469-480; Gould, N.I.M., Orban, D., Toint, P.L., CUTEr and SifDec: a constrained and unconstrained testing environment, revisited (2003) ACM Trans Math Softw, 29 (4), pp. 373-394; Grossmann, I.E., (1996) Global Optimization in Engineering Design, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Hansen, P., Jaumard, B., Lu, S.-H., Global optimization of univariate Lipschitz functions: II.

Moreover, when focusing in the short-term management, generation companies must include some medium-term products that directly influence their short-term strategies. In this work, the bilateral and physical futures contracts are included into the day-ahead market bid following MIBEL rules and a stochastic quadratic mixed-integer programming model is presented. The complexity of this stochastic programming problem makes unpractical the resolution of large-scale instances with general-purpose optimization codes. Therefore, in order to gain efficiency, a polyhedral outer approximation of the quadratic objective function obtained by means of perspective cuts (PC) is proposed. A set of instances of the problem has been defined with real data and solved with the PC methodology. The numerical results obtained show the efficiency of this methodology compared with standard mixed quadratic optimization solvers. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Liberalized electricity market; Optimal bid; Perspective cuts; Stochastic programming,,"Anderson, E., Philpott, A., Optimal offer construction in electricity markets (2002) Math Oper Res, 27 (1), pp. 82-100; Anderson, E., Xu, H., Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal offers in electricity markets (2002) SIAM J Control Optim, 41 (4), pp. 1212-1228; Bjorgan, R., Liu, C.C., Lawarrée, J., Financial risk management in a competitive electricity market (1999) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 14 (4), pp. 1285-1291; (2006) Boletin Oficial del Estado, p. 128. , BOE, 30/5/2006; (2006) Boletin Oficial del Estado, p. 158. , BOE, 4/7/2006; Carrión, M., Arroyo, J., A computationally efficient mixed-integer linear formulation for the thermal unit commitment problem (2006) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 21 (3), pp. 1371-1378; Chen, X., He, Y., Song, Y.H., Nakanishi, Y., Nakahishi, C., Takahashi, S., Sekine, Y., Study of impacts of physical contracts and financial contracts on bidding strategies of GenCos (2004) Electr Power Energy Syst, 26, pp. 715-723; Conejo, A.J., Nogales, F.J., Arroyo, J.M., Price-taker bidding strategy under price uncertainty (2002) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 17 (4), pp. 1081-1088; Conejo, A.J., García-Bertrand, R., Carrión, M., Caballero, A., de Andrés, A., Optimal involvement in futures markets of a power producer (2008) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 23 (2), pp. 703-711; Corchero, C., Heredia, F.J., A stochastic programming model for the thermal optimal day-ahead bid problem with physical futures contracts (2011) Comput Oper Res, 38 (11), pp. 1501-1512. , doi:10.1016/j.cor.2011.01.008; (2009) IBM ILOG CPLEX V12. 1 user's manual for CPLEX, , CPLEX, International Business Machines Corporation; Dahlgren, R., Liu, C.C., Lawarree, J., Risk assessment in energy trading (2003) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 18 (2), pp. 503-511; Escudero, L., Garín, M., Merino, M., Pérez, G., A general algorithm for solving two-stage stochastic mixed 0-1 first-stage problems (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36, pp. 2590-2600; Fleten, S.E., Kristoffersen, T.K., Stochastic programming for optimizing bidding strategies of a Nordic hydropower producer (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 181 (2), pp. 916-928; Frangioni, A., Gentile, C., Perspective cuts for a class of convex 0-1 mixed integer programs (2006) Math Program, 106, pp. 225-236; Frangioni, A., Gentile, C., A computational comparison of reformulations of the perspective relaxation: SOCP vs. cutting planes (2009) Oper Res Lett, 37, pp. 206-210; Gountis, V.P., Bakirtzis, A.G., Bidding strategies for electricity producers in a competitive electricity marketplace (2004) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 19 (1), pp. 356-365; Guan, X., Wu, J., Gao, F., Sun, G., Optimization-based generation asset allocation for forward and spot markets (2008) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 23 (4), pp. 1796-1807; Heredia, F.J., Rider, M., Corchero, C., Optimal bidding strategies for thermal and generic programming units in the day-ahead electricity market (2010) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 24 (4), pp. 1-9. , doi:10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2038269; Heredia, F.J., Rider, M.J., Corchero, C., A stochastic programming model for the optimal electricity market bid problem with bilateral contracts for thermal and combined cycle units (2011) Ann Oper Res, , (in press). doi: 10. 1007/s10479-011-0847-x; Hiriart-Urruty, J.B., Lemaréchal, C., (1993) Convex Analysis and Minimization Algorithms I.

Note that the predictive sample is stochastic for a set of given sample observations, the distance being consequently random. To circumvent the randomness, we choose the conditional expectation and qth quantile as the test statistics. Two statistics are related to the well-known Shapiro-Francia test, and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The simulation study shows that the new tests are able to better discriminate between the normal distribution and heavy-tailed distributions or mixed normal distributions. Against those alternatives, the new tests are more powerful than existing tests including the Anderson-Darling test and the Shapiro-Wilk test, which are two of the best tests of normality in the literature. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Anderson-Darling test; Goodness-of-fit test; Posterior predictive distribution; Predictive sample; Shapiro-Wilk test,,"Anderson, T.W., Darling, D.A., A test of goodness-of-fit (1954) J Am Stat Assoc, 49, pp. 765-769; Cramér, H., On the composition of elementary errors.

In the first case the system works under the partial acceptance policy. Explicit results are obtained for the corresponding stationary distribution, which extend previous relevant results. In the second case, where the system works under the all-or-nothing acceptance policy, a sufficient condition is given for the stationary distribution to have a closed-product form. In both cases customers depart individually, while the joint service time distribution of the accepted members of a group may depend both on its initial and the accepted size plus an additional condition. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Group arrivals; Insensitivity; M/G/k loss system; Stationary distribution; Supplementary variables,,"Chao, X., Miyazawa, M., Pinedo, M., (1999) Queueing Networks: Customers, Signals and Product Form Solutions, , Chichester: Wiley; Chen, S.P., A mathematical programming approach to fuzzy queues with batch arrivals (2004) Eng Optim, 36, pp. 635-644; Economou, A., Fakinos, D., Product form stationary distributions for the M/G/k group-arrival group-departure loss system under a general acceptance policy (1999) Eur J Oper Res, 112, pp. 196-206; Fakinos, D., The M/G/k group-arrival group-departure loss system (1982) J Appl Probab, 19, pp. 826-834; Fakinos, D., On the M/G/k group-arrival loss system (1990) Eur J Oper Res, 44, pp. 75-83; Fakinos, D., Sirakoulis, K., Product-form distributions for an M/G/k group-arrival group-departure loss system (1989) Adv Appl Probab, 21, pp. 721-724; Kelly, F.P., (1979) Reversibility and Stochastic Networks, , New York: Wiley; Papier, F., Wolff, R.W., Thonemann, U.W., On the convexity of loss probabilities when arrivals occur in batches and servers are heterogeneous (2007) Oper Res Lett, 35, pp. 467-471; Whittle, P., Partial balance, insensitivity and weak coupling (1986) Adv Appl Probab, 18, pp. 706-723; Wolff, R.W., (1989) Stochastic Modeling and the Theory of Queues, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall",English,Article

This algorithm consists of two main stages. In the first stage, a polyhedral conic set is used to identify data points which lie inside their classes, and in the second stage we exclude those points to compute a piecewise linear boundary using the remaining data points. Piecewise linear boundaries are computed incrementally starting with one hyperplane. Such an approach allows one to significantly reduce the computational effort in many large data sets. Results of numerical experiments are reported. These results demonstrate that the new algorithm consistently produces a good test set accuracy on most data sets comparing with a number of other mainstream classifiers. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Data mining; Nonsmooth optimization; Piecewise linear classifiers; Piecewise linear separability; Supervised learning,,"Astorino, A., Gaudioso, M., Polyhedral separability through successive LP (2002) J Optim Theory Appl, 112 (2), pp. 265-293; Asuncion, A., Newman, D., (2007) UCI machine learning repository, , http://www.ics.uci.edu/mlearn/MLRepository.html; Bagirov, A.M., Minimization methods for one class of nonsmooth functions and calculation of semi-equilibrium prices (1999) Progress in Optimization: Contribution from Australasia, pp. 147-175. , Norwell: Kluwer Academic; Bagirov, A.M., A method for minimization of quasidifferentiable functions (2002) Optim Methods Softw, 17 (1), pp. 31-60; Bagirov, A.M., Max-min separability (2005) Optim Methods Softw, 20 (2-3), pp. 271-290; Bagirov, A.M., Ugon, J., Supervised data classification via max-min separability (2005) Continuous Optimisation: Current Trends and Modern Applications, pp. 175-208. , Chap 6, Berlin: Springer; Bagirov, A.M., Ugon, J., Piecewise partially separable functions and a derivative-free method for large-scale nonsmooth optimization (2006) J Glob Optim, 35, pp. 163-195; Bagirov, A.M., Karasozen, B., Sezer, M., Discrete gradient method: derivative-free method for nonsmooth optimization (2008) J Optim Theory Appl, 137, pp. 317-334; Bagirov, A.M., Ugon, J., Webb, D., Karasözen, B., Classification through incremental max-min separability (2011) Pattern Anal Appl, 14, pp. 165-174; Bagirov, A.M., Ugon, J., Webb, D., An efficient algorithm for the incremental construction of a piecewise linear classifier (2011) Inf Syst, 36, pp. 782-790; Bobrowski, L., Design of piecewise linear classifiers from formal neurons by a basis exchange technique (1991) Pattern Recognit, 24 (9), pp. 863-870; Demyanov, V.F., Mathematical diagnostics via nonsmooth analysis (2005) Optim Methods Softw, 20 (2-3), pp. 191-212; Gasimov, R.N., Ozturk, G., Separation via polyhedral conic functions (2006) Optim Methods Softw, 21 (4), pp. 527-540; Michie, D., Spiegelhalter, D.J., Taylor, C.C., Campbell, J., (1994) Machine Learning, Neural and Statistical Classification, , Upper Saddle River: Ellis Horwood; Orsenigo, C., Vercellis, C., Accurately learning from few examples with a polyhedral classifier (2007) Comput Optim Appl, 38 (2), pp. 235-247; Palm, H., A new piecewise linear classifier (1990) Proceedings 10th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, 1, pp. 742-744; Park, Y., Sklansky, J., Automated design of multiple-class piecewise linear classifiers (1989) J Classif, 6, pp. 195-222; Schulmeister, B., Wysotzki, F., The piecewise linear classifier DIPOL92 (1994) Proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 411-414. , Catania, Italy, F.

The shape restriction we deal with is an extension of the notion of convexity named α-convexity. Instead of assuming, as in the convex case, the existence of a separating hyperplane for each exterior point of S, we assume the existence of a separating open ball with radius α. Given an α-convex set S, the α-convex hull of independent random points in S is the natural estimator of the set. If α is unknown the rn-convex hull of the sample can be considered being rn a sequence of positive numbers. We analyze the asymptotic properties of the rn-convex hull estimator in the bidimensional case and obtain the convergence rate for the expected distance in measure between the set and the estimator. The geometrical complexity of the estimator and its dependence on rn are also obtained via the analysis of the expected number of vertices of the rn-convex hull. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",α-convex set; Convex set; Distance in measure; Image analysis; Set estimation,,"Baíllo, A., Cuevas, A., On the estimation of a star-shaped set (2001) Adv Appl Probab, 33, pp. 1-10; Barnett, V., The ordering of multivariate data (1976) J R Stat Soc, Ser A, Stat Soc, 139, pp. 318-355; Benson, R.V., (1966) Euclidean Geometry and Convexity, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Billingsley, P., (1995) Probability and Measure, , New York: Wiley; Croft, H.T., Falconer, K.J., Guy, R.K., (1991) Unsolved Problems in Geometry, , New York: Springer; Cuevas, A., Fraiman, R., Set estimation (2009) New Perspectives on Stochastic Geometry, pp. 366-389. , W.

Our approach employs non-uniform probability distributions to add a biased random behavior to the well-known savings heuristic. By doing so, a large set of alternative good solutions can be quickly obtained in a natural way and without complex configuration processes. Since the solution-generation process is based on the criterion of maximizing the savings, it does not need to assume any particular property of the objective function. Therefore, the procedure can be especially useful in problems where properties such as non-smoothness or non-convexity lead to a highly irregular solution space, for which the traditional optimization methods-both of exact and approximate nature-may fail to reach their full potential. The results obtained so far are promising enough to suggest that the idea of using biased probability distributions to randomize classical heuristics is a powerful one that can be successfully applied in a variety of cases. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Biased random search; Combinatorial optimization; Heuristics; Randomized algorithms; Vehicle routing problem,,"Al-Sultan, K.S., A tabu search approach to the clustering problem (1995) Pattern Recognit, 28 (9), pp. 1443-1451; Bagirov, A.M., Yearwood, J., A new nonsmooth optimization algorithm for minimum sum-of-squares clustering problems (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 170, pp. 578-596; Bagirov, A., Lai, D.T.H., Palaniswami, M., A nonsmooth optimization approach to sensor network localization (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 International Conference on Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing, pp. 727-732. , M.

Controlled tabular adjustment (CTA) is an emerging technique for the protection of statistical tabular data. Given a table with sensitive information, CTA looks for the closest safe table. In this work we focus on CTA for three-dimensional tables using the L1 norm for the distance between the original and protected tables. Three L1-CTA models are presented, giving rise to six different primal block-angular structures of the constraint matrices. The resulting linear programming problems are solved by a specialized interior-point algorithm for this constraints structure which solves the normal equations by a combination of Cholesky factorization and preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG). In the past this algorithm was shown to be one of the most efficient approaches for some classes of block-angular problems. The effect of quadratic regularizations is also analyzed, showing that for three of the six primal block-angular structures the performance of PCG is guaranteed to improve. Computational results are reported for a set of large instances, which provide linear optimization problems of up to 50 million variables and 25 million constraints. The specialized interior-point algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art barrier solver of the CPLEX 12. 1 package, showing to be a more efficient choice for very large L1-CTA instances. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Controlled tabular adjustment; Interior-point methods; Large-scale computational optimization; Preconditioned conjugate gradient; Primal block-angular problems; Regularizations; Statistical tabular data protection,,"Castro, J., A specialized interior-point algorithm for multicommodity network flows (2000) SIAM J Opt, 10, pp. 852-877; Castro, J., Quadratic interior-point methods in statistical disclosure control (2005) Comput Manag Sci, 2, pp. 107-121; Castro, J., Minimum-distance controlled perturbation methods for large-scale tabular data protection (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 171, pp. 39-52; Castro, J., An interior-point approach for primal block-angular problems (2007) Comput Optim Appl, 36, pp. 195-219; Castro, J., A shortest paths heuristic for statistical disclosure control in positive tables (2007) INFORMS J Comput, 19, pp. 520-533; Castro, J., Cuesta, J., Quadratic regularizations in an interior-point method for primal block-angular problems (2011) Math Program, 130, pp. 415-445; Domingo-Ferrer, J., Magkos, E., (2010) Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

The so-called dynamic relay deployment problem consists of finding the optimum number of deployed relays and their location aimed at simultaneously maximizing the overall number of mobile nodes covered and minimizing the cost of the deployment. In this paper, we extend the problem by considering diverse relay models characterized by different coverage radii and associated costs. To efficiently tackle this problem we derive a novel hybrid scheme comprising: (1) a Harmony Search (HS)-based global search procedure and (2) a modified version of the well-known K-means clustering algorithm as a local search technique. Single- and bi-objective formulations of the algorithm are proposed for emergency and strategic operational planning, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations are run over a emulated scenario based on real statistical data from the Castilla La Mancha region (center of Spain) to show that, in comparison with a standard implementation of the K-means algorithm followed by a exhaustive search procedure over all relay-model combinations, the proposed scheme renders on average better coverage levels and reduced costs providing, at the same time, an intelligent tool capable of simultaneously determining the number and models of the relays to be deployed. © 2013, Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Clustering; Disaster communications; Dynamic relay deployment; Harmony Search; Hybrid algorithms,,"Akella, M.R., Batta, R., Delmelle, E.M., Rogerson, P.A., Blatt, A., Wilson, G., Base station location and channel allocation in a cellular network with emergency coverage requirements (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 164 (2), pp. 301-323; Agnetis, A., Grande, E., Mirchandani, P.B., Pacifici, A., Covering a line segment with variable radius discs (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36 (5), pp. 1423-1436; Alevras, D., Padberg, M.W., (2001) Linear optimization and extensions: problems and solutions.

The aim is to estimate the influence of covariates on observations, drawn from an exponential distribution. The link considered has a semiparametric expression: if we are interested in a functional influence of some covariates, we authorize others to be modeled linearly. We thus consider a generalized partially linear regression model with unknown regression coefficients and an unknown nonparametric function. We present a maximum penalized likelihood procedure to estimate the components of the model introducing penalty based wavelet estimators. Asymptotic rates of the estimates of both the parametric and the nonparametric part of the model are given and quasi-minimax optimality is obtained under usual conditions in literature. We establish in particular that the ℓ1-penalty leads to an adaptive estimation with respect to the regularity of the estimated function. An algorithm based on backfitting and Fisher-scoring is also proposed for implementation. Simulations are used to illustrate the finite sample behavior, including a comparison with kernel- and spline-based methods. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Generalized partially linear regression; M-estimation; Penalized loglikelihood estimation; Semiparametric models; Wavelet thresholding,,"Aldrich, E., (2010) Wavelets: A package of functions for computing wavelet filters, wavelet transforms and multiresolution analyses, , http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wavelets, R package version 0.2-6; Antoniadis, A., Smoothing noisy data with tapered coiflets series (1996) Scand J Stat, 23 (3), pp. 313-330; Antoniadis, A., Fan, J., Regularization of wavelet approximations (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96 (455), pp. 939-967; Antoniadis, A., Sapatinas, T., Wavelet shrinkage for natural exponential families with quadratic variance functions (2001) Biometrika, 88, pp. 805-820; Antoniadis, A., Besbeas, P., Sapatinas, T., Wavelet shrinkage for natural exponential families with cubic variance functions (2001) Sankhya Indian J Stat, 363 (3), pp. 309-327; Antoniadis, A., Gijbels, I., Nikolova, M., Penalized likelihood regression for generalized linear models with nonquadratic penalties (2011) Ann Inst Stat Math, 63 (3), pp. 585-615; Bai, Z., Rao, C., Wu, Y., M-estimation of multivariate linear regression parameters under a convex discrepancy function (1992) Stat Sin, 2, pp. 237-254; Birgé, L., Massart, P., An adaptive compression algorithm in Besov spaces (2000) Constr Approx, 16, pp. 1-36; Boente, G., He, X., Zhou, J., Robust estimates in generalized partially linear models (2006) Ann Stat, 34 (6), pp. 2856-2878; Brown, L., Cai, T., Zhou, H., Nonparametric regression in exponential families (2010) Ann Stat, 38 (4), pp. 2005-2046; Chang, X.W., Qu, L., Wavelet estimation of partially linear models (2004) Comput Stat Data Anal, 47 (1), pp. 31-48; Chen, H., (1987) Estimation of semiparametric generalized linear models, , Tech rep, State University of New, York; Craven, P., Wahba, G., Smoothing noisy data with spline functions: estimating the correct degree of smoothing by the method of generalized cross-validation (1979) Numer Math, 31, pp. 377-403; Daubechies, I., (1992) Ten Lectures on Wavelets, 61. , Philadelphia: SIAM; Donoho, D., Johnstone, I., Ideal spatial adaptation by wavelet shrinkage (1994) Biometrika, 81 (3), pp. 425-455; Donoho, D., Johnstone, I., Adapting to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage (1995) J Am Stat Assoc, 90 (432), pp. 1200-1224; Donoho, D., Johnstone, I., Minimax estimation via wavelet shrinkage (1998) Ann Stat, 26 (3), pp. 879-921; Donoho, D., Johnstone, I., Kerkyacharian, G., Picard, D., Wavelet shrinkage: asymptotia?

A back-fitting algorithm to attain the maximum penalized likelihood estimates (MPLEs) by using natural cubic smoothing splines is presented. In particular, the score functions and Fisher information matrices for the parameters of interest are expressed in a similar notation of that used in parametric symmetric models. Sufficient conditions on the existence of the MPLEs are presented as well as some inferential results and discussions on degrees of freedom and smoothing parameter estimation.

The model can be considered static and takes into account the average flows of passengers over a given period of time (i. e., the peak morning traffic hour). Auxiliary bus services must accommodate very high demand levels, and the model presented is able to take into account the operation of a bus-bridging system under congested conditions. A general analysis of the congestion in public transportation lines is presented, and the results are applied to the design of a bus-bridging system. A nonlinear integer mathematical programming model and a suitable approximation of this model are then formulated. This approximated model can be solved by a heuristic procedure that has been shown to be computationally viable. The output of the model is as follows: (a) the number of bus units to assign to each of the candidate lines of the bus-bridging system; (b) the routes to be followed by users passengers of each of the origin-destination pairs; (c) the operational conditions of the components of the bus-bridging system, including the passenger load of each of the line segments, the degree of saturation of the bus stops relative to their bus input flows, the bus service times at bus stops and the passenger waiting times at bus stops. The model is able to take into account bounds with regard to the maximum number of passengers waiting at bus stops and the space available at bus stops for the queueing of bus units. This paper demonstrates the applicability of the model with two realistic test cases: a railway corridor in Madrid and a metro line in Barcelona. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Auxiliary bus lines; Congestion modeling; Frequency design; Public transportation,,"Adebisi, O., A mathematical model for the headway variance of fixed-route buses (1986) Transp Res B, 1, pp. 59-70; Allen, A.O., (1998) Probability, Statistics and Queueing Theory, , New York: Academic Press; Anderson, P.A., Scalia-Tomba, G.P., A mathematical model of a bus route (1981) Transp Res B, 15 (4), pp. 249-266; Bailey, N.T.J., On queueing process with bulk service (1954) J R Stat Soc B, 16, pp. 80-87; Cepeda, M., Cominetti, R., Florian, M., A frequency-based assignment model for congested transit networks with strict capacity constraints: characterization and computation of equilibria (2006) Trans Res B, 40, pp. 437-459; (2010) EMME Userś Manual, , INRO Consultants, Software Release 9. 1; Constantin, I., Florian, M., Optimizing frequencies in a transit network: a non-linear bi-level programming approach (1995) Int Trans Oper Res, 2, pp. 149-164; Fernández, R., Tayler, N., Effect of passenger-bus-traffic interactions on bus stop operations (2005) Transp Plan Technol, 28 (4), pp. 272-292; Fernández, R., Modelling of bus-stop operations (2011) Proceedings of the European Transport Conference, , www.etcproceedings.org/paper/download/2637, last access June 21st (2011); Guenthner, R.P., Sinha, K.C., Modeling bus delays due to passenger boardings and alightings (1983) Transp Res Rec, 915, pp. 7-13; Haupt, T., Nökel, K., Reiter, U., Schedule based dynamic transit assignment (2009) Schedule-Based Modeling of Transportaion Networks, , N.

Let S:A{long rightwards arrow}B and T:A{long rightwards arrow}B be nonself-mappings. Considering the fact S and T are nonself-mappings, it is feasible that the equations Sx=x and Tx=x have no common solution, designated as a common fixed point of the mappings S and T. Eventually, when the equations have no common solution, one contemplates to figure out an element x that is in close proximity to Sx and Tx in the sense that d(x,Sx) and d(x,Tx) are minimum. In fact, common best proximity point theorems scrutinize the existence of such optimal approximate solutions, known as common best proximity points, to the equations Sx=x and Tx=x in the event that the equations have no common solution. Further, one can perceive that the real-valued functions x{long rightwards arrow}d(x,Sx) and x{long rightwards arrow}d(x,Tx) estimate the magnitude of the error involved for any common approximate solution of the equations Sx=x and Tx=x. In light of the fact that the distance between x and Sx, and the distance between x and Tx are at least the distance between A and B for all x in A, a common best proximity point theorem ascertains global minimum of both functions x{long rightwards arrow}d(x,Sx) and x{long rightwards arrow}d(x,Tx) by limiting a common approximate solution of the equations Sx=x and Tx=x to fulfil the requirement that d(x,Sx)=d(A,B) and d(x,Tx)=d(A,B). This article discusses a common best proximity point theorem for a pair of nonself-mappings, one of which dominates the other proximally, thereby yielding common optimal approximate solutions of some fixed point equations when there is no common solution. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Common best proximity point; Common fixed point; Global optimal approximate solution; Proximally dominating mappings,,"Al-Thagafi, M.A., Shahzad, N., Best proximity sets and equilibrium pairs for a finite family of multimaps (2008) Fixed Point Theory Appl, 2008, p. 10. , 457069; Al-Thagafi, M.A., Shahzad, N., Convergence and existence results for best proximity points (2009) Nonlinear Anal, 70 (10), pp. 3665-3671; Al-Thagafi, M.A., Shahzad, N., Best proximity pairs and equilibrium pairs for Kakutani multimaps (2009) Nonlinear Anal, 70 (3), pp. 1209-1216; Anuradha, J., Veeramani, P., Proximal pointwise contraction (2009) Topology Appl, 156 (18), pp. 2942-2948; Di Bari, C., Suzuki, T., Vetro, C., Best proximity points for cyclic Meir-Keeler contractions (2008) Nonlinear Anal, 69 (11), pp. 3790-3794; Eldred, A.A., Veeramani, P., Existence and convergence of best proximity points (2006) J Math Anal Appl, 323, pp. 1001-1006; Eldred, A.A., Kirk, W.A., Veeramani, P., Proximinal normal structure and relatively nonexpansive mappings (2005) Studia Math, 171 (3), pp. 283-293; Fan, K., Extensions of two fixed point theorems of FE Browder (1969) Math Z, 112, pp. 234-240; Jungck, G., Commuting mappings and fixed points (1976) Amer Math Monthly, 83, pp. 261-263; Karpagam, S., Agrawal, S., Best proximity point theorems for p-cyclic Meir-Keeler contractions (2009) Fixed Point Theory Appl, 2009, p. 9. , 197308; Kim, W.K., Kum, S., Lee, K.H., On general best proximity pairs and equilibrium pairs in free abstract economies (2008) Nonlinear Anal, 68 (8), pp. 2216-2227; Kirk, W.A., Reich, S., Veeramani, P., Proximinal retracts and best proximity pair theorems (2003) Numer Funct Anal Optim, 24, pp. 851-862; Prolla, J.B., Fixed point theorems for set valued mappings and existence of best approximations (1982) Numer Funct Anal Optim, 5, pp. 449-455; Reich, S., Approximate selections, best approximations, fixed points and invariant sets (1978) J Math Anal Appl, 62, pp. 104-113; Sadiq Basha, S., Best proximity points: global optimal approximate solution (2010) J Global Optim, , doi:10.1007/s10898-009-9521-0; Sadiq Basha, S., Extensions of Banach's contraction principle (2010) Numer Funct Anal Optim, 31, pp. 569-576; Sadiq Basha, S., Veeramani, P., Best approximations and best proximity pairs (1997) Acta Sci Math (Szeged), 63, pp. 289-300; Sadiq Basha, S., Veeramani, P., Best proximity pair theorems for multifunctions with open fibres (2000) J Approx Theory, 103, pp. 119-129; Sadiq Basha, S., Veeramani, P., Pai, D.V., Best proximity pair theorems (2001) Indian J Pure Appl Math, 32, pp. 1237-1246; Sankar Raj, V., Veeramani, P., Best proximity pair theorems for relatively nonexpansive mappings (2009) Appl Gen Topol, 10 (1), pp. 21-28; Sehgal, V.M., Singh, S.P., A generalization to multifunctions of Fan's best approximation theorem (1988) Proc Am Math Soc, 102, pp. 534-537; Sehgal, V.M., Singh, S.P., A theorem on best approximations (1989) Numer Funct Anal Optim, 10, pp. 181-184; Srinivasan, P.S., Best proximity pair theorems (2001) Acta Sci Math (Szeged), 67, pp. 421-429; Vetrivel, V., Veeramani, P., Bhattacharyya, P., Some extensions of Fan's best approximation theorem (1992) Numer Funct Anal Optim, 13, pp. 397-402; Wlodarczyk, K., Plebaniak, R., Banach, A., Best proximity points for cyclic and noncyclic set-valued relatively quasi-asymptotic contractions in uniform spaces (2009) Nonlinear Anal, 70 (9), pp. 3332-3341",English,Article

This is termed inventory centralization and is a type of risk pooling. The expected centralization cost can be lowered even further, without disrupting the demand behavior at individual outlets, by inducing the outlets to correlate their individual demands. Given that the outlets' demands are normally distributed, the lowering of the centralized cost corresponds to a semidefinite optimization problem. This paper establishes a closed-form optimal solution of the semidefinite program and a fair allocation of the centralized cost at optimality. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Convex optimization; Cooperative game theory; Inventory centralization; Risk pooling,,"Benjaafar, S., Cooper, W.L., Kim, J.-S., On the benefits of pooling in production-inventory systems (2005) Manag Sci, 51 (4), pp. 548-5651; Chase, R., Aquilano, N., (1992) Production and Operations Management, , 6th edn., Homewood: Irwin; Cherikh, M., On the effect of centralization on expected profits in multi-location Newsboy problem (2000) J Oper Res Soc, 51, pp. 755-761; Dror, M., Hartman, B.C., Chang, W., (2008) Core, concavity, and cost allocation for consolidation of inventory ordering, , Working Paper, MIS, Eller College of Managament, University of Arizona (submitted for publication; Eppen, G., Effects of centralization on expected costs in a multi-location newsboy problem (1979) Manag Sci, 25 (5), pp. 498-501; Gerchak, Y., Gupta, D., On apportioning costs to customers in centralized continuous review inventory systems (1991) J Oper Manag, 10, pp. 546-551; Gerchak, Y., He, Q.-M., On the relation between the benefits of risk pooling and the variability of demand (2003) IIE Trans, 35, pp. 1027-1031; Goemans, M., Williamson, D., Improved approximation algorithms for maximum cut and satisfiability problems using semidefinite programming (1995) J Acm, 42, pp. 1115-1145; Hartman, B.C., (1994) Cooperative games and inventory cost allocation, , PhD Thesis, Eller College of Management, University of Arizona; Hartman, B.C., Dror, M., Cost allocation in continuous review inventory models (1996) Nav Res Logist, 43, pp. 549-561; Hartman, B.C., Dror, M., Optimizing centralized inventory operations in a cooperative game theory setting (2003) IIE Trans Oper Eng, 35, pp. 243-257; Hartman, B.C., Dror, M., Shaked, M., Cores of inventory centralization games (2000) Games Econ Behav, 31 (1), pp. 26-49; Lee, H.L., Padmanabhan, V., Whang, S., The bullwhip effect in supply chains (1997) Sloan Manag Rev, 38 (3), pp. 93-102; Pataki, G., On the rank of extreme matrices in semidefinite programs and the multiplicity of optimal eigenvalues (1998) Math Oper Res, 23 (2), pp. 339-358; Peleg, B., Sudhölter, P., (2003) Introduction to the Theory of Cooperative Games, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Ruusunen, J., Ehtamo, H., Hamalainen, R., Dynamic cooperative electricity exchange in a power pool (1991) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern, 21 (4), pp. 758-766; Schmeidler, D., The nucleolus of a characteristic function game (1969) SIAM J Appl Math, 17, pp. 1163-1170; Shapiro, A., Weighted minimum trace factor analysis (1982) Psychometrika, 47, pp. 243-264; Shapley, L., A value for n-person games (1953) Contributions to the Theory of Games, 2, pp. 307-317. , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Shen, Z.-J.M., Coullard, C., Daskin, M.S., A joint location-inventory model (2003) Transp Sci, 37 (1), pp. 40-45; Wolkowicz, H., Saigal, R., Vandenberghe, L., (2000) Handbook of Semidefinite Programming, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Young, H.P., (1985) Cost Allocation: Methods, Principles, Applications, Chap 1, pp. 3-29. , Amsterdam: Elsevier/North-Holland; Young, H.P., Monotonic solutions of cooperative games (1985) Int J Game Theory, 14, pp. 65-72",English,Article

Cellular Manufacturing is a production strategy that has emerged to reduce materials handling and set up times in order to reduce lead times in production systems and to improve customer's service levels while reducing costs. We propose a GRASP heuristic to obtain lower bounds for the optimal solution of the problem. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we test the heuristic with different instances from the literature and compare the results obtained with those provided by other heuristic methods from the literature. According to the obtained results, the proposed GRASP procedure provides good quality lower bounds with reasonable computational effort. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Group technology;

It is shown that Hager's 1-norm condition number estimator is equivalent to the conditional gradient algorithm applied to the problem of maximizing the 1-norm of a matrix-vector product over the unit sphere in the 1-norm. By changing the constraint in this optimization problem from the unit sphere to the unit simplex, a new formulation is obtained which is the basis for both conditional gradient and projected gradient algorithms. In the test problems, the spectral projected gradient algorithm yields condition number estimates at least as good as those obtained by the previous approach. Moreover, in some cases, the spectral gradient projection algorithm, with a careful choice of the parameters, yields improved condition number estimates. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Condition number; Gradient algorithms; Nonlinear programming; Numerical linear algebra,,"Bazaraa, M.S., Sherali, H.D., Shetty, C., (1993) Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Bertsekas, D.P., (2003) Nonlinear Programming, , 2nd edn., Belmont: Athena Scientific; Birgin, E.G., Martínez, J.M., Raydan, M., Nonmonotone spectral projected gradient methods on convex sets (2000) SIAM J Optim, 10, pp. 1196-1211; Birgin, E.G., Martínez, J.M., Raydan, M., Algorithm 813: Spg-software for convex constrained optimization (2001) ACM Trans Math Softw, 27, pp. 340-349; Boisvert, R., Pozo, R., Remington, K., Miller, B., Lipman, R., (1998) Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division of Information Technology Laboratory of National Institute of Standards and Technology, , http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html, Available at; Cottle, R., Pang, J., Stone, R., (1992) The Linear Complementarity Problem, , New York: Academic Press; Demmel, J.W., (1997) Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, , Philadelphia: SIAM; Gill, P., Murray, W., Wright, M., (1991) Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimization, , New York: Addison-Wesley; Golub, G.H., Loan, C.F.V., (1996) Matrix Computations, , 3rd edn., Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press; Hager, W.W., Condition estimates (1984) SIAM J Sci Stat Comput, 5 (2), pp. 311-316; Hager, W.W., (1998) Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Higham, N.J., FORTRAN codes for estimating the one-norm of a real or complex matrix with applications to condition estimation (1988) ACM Trans Math Softw, 14 (4), pp. 381-396; Higham, N.J., (1996) Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms, , Philadelphia: SIAM; Johnson, C., (1990) Numerical Solution of Partial Differential Equations by the Finite Element Method, , London: Cambridge University Press; Júdice, J.J., Raydan, M., Rosa, S.S., Santos, S.A., On the solution of the symmetric eigenvalue complementarity problem by the spectral projected gradient algorithm (2008) Numer Algorithms, 44, pp. 391-407; Moler, C., Little, J.N., Bangert, S., (2001) Matlab User's Guide-the Language of Technical Computing, , Sherborn: The MathWorks; Murty, K., (1976) Linear and Combinatorial Programming, , New York: Wiley; Murty, K., (1988) Linear Complementarity, Linear and Nonlinear Programming, , Berlin: Heldermann",English,Article

The product is distributed from plants to distribution centers and then to customers. There are several transportation channels available for each pair of facilities between echelons. These transportation channels introduce a cost-time tradeoff in the problem that allows us to formulate it as a bi-objective mixed-integer program. The decisions to be taken are the location of the distribution centers, the selection of the transportation channels, and the flow between facilities. Three variations of the classic ε-constraint method for generating optimal Pareto fronts are studied in this paper. The procedures are tested over six different classes of instance sets. The three sets of smallest size were solved completely obtaining their efficient solution set. It was observed that one of the three proposed algorithms consistently outperformed the other two in terms of their execution time. Additionally, four schemes for obtaining lower bound sets are studied. These schemes are based on linear programming relaxations of the model. The contribution of this work is the introduction of a new bi-objective optimization problem, and a computational study of the ε-constraint methods for obtaining optimal efficient fronts and the lower bounding schemes. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",ε-constraint method; Bi-objective programming; Branch and bound; Integer programming; Location; Supply chain,,"Aikens, C.H., Facility location models for distribution planning (1985) Eur J Oper Res, 22 (3), pp. 263-279; Altiparmak, F., Gen, M., Lin, L., Paksoy, T., A genetic algorithm approach for multi-objective optimization of supply chain networks (2006) Comput Indust Eng, 51 (1), pp. 197-216; Arntzen, B.C., Brown, G.C., Harrison, T.P., Trafton, L.L., Global supply chain management at Digital Equipment Corporation (1995) Interfaces, 25 (1), pp. 69-93; Ballou, R.H., (1999) Business Logistics Management, , New York: Prentice Hall; Baumol, W.J., Wolfe, P., A warehouse-location problem (1958) Oper Res, 6 (2), pp. 252-263; Benjamin, J., An analysis of mode choice for shippers in a constrained network with applications to just-in-time inventory (1990) Transp Res Part B, 24 (3), pp. 229-245; Chan, F.T.S., Chung, S.H., Choy, K.L., Optimization of order fulfillment in distribution network problems (2006) J Intell Manuf, 17 (3), pp. 307-319; Chopra, S., Meindl, P., (2004) Supply Chain Management: Strategy, Planning, and Operation, , New York: Prentice Hall; Cordeau, J.F., Pasin, F., Solomon, M.M., An integrated model for logistics network design (2006) Ann Oper Res, 144 (1), pp. 59-82; Cornuejols, G., Nemhauser, G.L., Wolsey, L.A., The uncapacitated facility location problem (1990) Discrete Location Theory, pp. 119-171. , Chap 3, P.

For some competitive facility location problems on a network, it is verified that optimal (or near-optimal) locations are found in the set of nodes and isodistant points (or points in the vicinity of isodistant points). While the nodes are known, the isodistant points have to be determined for each problem. Surprisingly, no algorithm has been proposed to generate the isodistant points on a network. In this paper, we present a variety of such problems and propose an algorithm to find all isodistant points for given threshold distances associated with the nodes. The number of isodistant points is upper bounded by nm, where n and m are the number of nodes and the number of edges, respectively. Computational experiments are presented which show that isodistant points can be generated in short run time and the number of such points is much smaller than nm. Thus, for networks of moderate size, it is possible to find optimal (or near-optimal) solutions through the Integer Linear Programming formulations corresponding to the discrete version of such problems, in which a finite set of points are taken as location candidates. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Facility location; Spatial competition; Threshold distances,,"D'Aspremont, C., Gabszewicz, J., Thisse, J.F., On Hotelling's Stability in Competition (1979) Econometrica, 47, pp. 1145-1150; Dorta-González, P., Santos-Peñate, D.R., Suárez-Vega, R., Spatial competition in networks under delivered pricing (2005) Pap Reg Sci, 84, pp. 271-280; Eiselt, H.A., Hotelling's duopoly on a tree (1992) Ann Oper Res, 40, pp. 195-207; Eiselt, H.A., Laporte, G., Location of a new facility in the presence of weights (1988) Asia-Pac J Oper Res, 15, pp. 160-165; Eiselt, H.A., Laporte, G., The maximum capture problem in a weighted network (1989) J Reg Sci, 29, pp. 433-439; Eiselt, H.A., Laporte, G., Thisse, J.F., Competitive location models: A framework and bibliography (1993) Transp Sci, 27, pp. 44-54; Fernández, P., Pelegrín, B., García, M.D., Peeters, P., A discrete long-term location-price problem under the assumption of discriminatory pricing: Formulations and parametric analysis (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 179, pp. 1050-1062; Friesz, T.L., Miller, T., Tobin, R.L., Competitive network facility location models: A survey (1988) Pap Reg Sci Assoc, 65, pp. 47-57; Gabszewicz, J.J., Thisse, J.F., Location (1992) Handbook of Game Theory with Economic Applications, pp. 281-304. , R.

The paper solves these drawbacks. We introduce a 1-concave basis for the entire space of all TU games wherefrom it follows that every TU game is either 1-convex/1-concave or is a sum of 1-convex and 1-concave games. Thus we may conclude that the classes of 1-convex/1-concave games constitute rather considerable subsets in the entire game space. On the other hand, an appealing practical example of 1-concave game has cropped up in Sales's study (Ph.

A matrix of the vote counts of the parties within the constituencies is given, and one has to convert the vote matrix into an integer matrix of seats ""as proportional as possible"" to it, subject to the constraints that each constituency be granted its pre-specified number of seats, each party be allotted the total number of seats it is entitled to on the basis of its national vote count, and a zero-vote zero-seat condition be satisfied. The matrix of seats must simultaneously meet the integrality and the proportionality requirement, and this not infrequently gives rise to self-contradictory procedures in the electoral laws of some countries. Here we discuss a class of methods for Biproportional Apportionment characterized by an ""error minimization"" approach. If the integrality requirement is relaxed, fractional seat allocations (target shares) can be obtained so as to achieve proportionality at least in theory. In order to restore integrality, one then looks for integral apportionments that are as close as possible to the ideal ones in a suitable metric. This leads to the formulation of constrained optimization problems called ""best approximation problems"" which are solvable in polynomial time through the use of network flow techniques. These error minimization methods can be viewed as an alternative to the classical axiomatic approach introduced by Balinski and Demange (in Math Oper Res 14:700-719, 1989a; Math Program 45:193-210, 1989b). We provide an empirical comparison between these two approaches with a real example from the Italian Elections and a theoretical discussion about the axioms that are not necessarily satisfied by the error minimization methods. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Biproportional apportionment; Error minimization; Metric spaces; Network flows,,"Ahuja, R.K., Magnanti, T.L., Orlin, J.B., (1993) Network Flows.

A tail index estimator can therefore be constructed by solving the sample moment equation with the unknown parameters being replaced by its quasi-maximum likelihood estimates (QMLE). To construct a confidence interval for the tail index, one needs to estimate the non-trivial asymptotic variance of the QMLE. In this paper, an empirical likelihood method is proposed for interval estimation of the tail index. One advantage of the proposed method is that interval estimation can still be achieved without having to estimate the complicated asymptotic variance. A simulation study confirms the advantage of the proposed method. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Empirical likelihood; GARCH model; Tail index,,"Basrak, B., Davis, R.A., Mikosch, T., Regular variation of GARCH processes (2002) Stoch Process Appl, 99, pp. 95-115; Berkes, I., Horváth, L., Kokoszka, P., Estimation of the maximal moment exponent of a GARCH(1,1) sequence (2003) Econom Theory, 19, pp. 565-586; Berkes, I., Horváth, L., Kokoszka, P., GARCH processes: structure and estimation (2003) Bernoulli, 9, pp. 201-207; Chen, S.X., van Keilegom, I., A review on empirical likelihood methods for regression (2009) Test, 18, pp. 415-447; Cont, R., Tankov, P., (2004) Financial Modeling with Jump Processes, , New York: Chapman and Hall; de Haan, L., Ferreira, A., (2006) Extreme Value Theory: An Introduction, , New York: Springer; Drees, H., Weighted approximations for tail processes for β-mixing random variables (2000) Ann Appl Probab, 10, pp. 1274-1301; Goldie, C.M., Implicit renewal theory and tails of solutions of random equations (1991) Ann Appl Probab, 1, pp. 126-166; Hall, P., Heyde, C.C., (1980) Martingale Limit Theory and Its Application, , New York: Academic Press; Hall, P., Yao, Q., Inference in ARCH and GARCH models (2003) Econometrica, 71, pp. 285-317; Hill, B.M., A simple general approach to inference about the tail of a distribution (1975) Ann Stat, 3, pp. 1163-1174; Iglesias, E.M., Linton, O.B., (2009) Estimation of tail thickness parameters from GJR-GARCH models, , Working Paper 09-47, Economic Series (26), Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; Kesten, H., Random difference equations and renewal theory for products of random matrices (1973) Acta Math, 131, pp. 207-248; Ling, S., Self-weighted and local quasi-maximum likelihood estimators for ARMA-GARCH/IGARCH models (2007) J Econom, 140, pp. 849-873; Mikosch, T., Stǎricǎ, C., Limit theory for the sample autocorrelations and extremes of a GARCH(1,1) process (2000) Ann Stat, 28, pp. 1427-1451; Mikosch, T., Straumann, D., Stable limits of martingale transforms with application to the estimation of Garch parameters (2006) Ann Stat, 34, pp. 493-522; Nelson, D.B., Stationary and persistence in GARCH(1,1) models (1990) Econom Theory, 6, pp. 318-334; Owen, A.B., Empirical likelihood confidence regions (1990) Ann Stat, 18, pp. 90-120; Owen, A.B., (2001) Empirical Likelihood, , New York: Chapman and Hall; Qin, J., Lawless, J., Empirical likelihood and general estimating equations (1994) Ann Stat, 22, pp. 300-325; Quintos, C., Fan, Z., Phillips, P.C.B., Structural change tests in tail behaviour and the Asian crisis (2001) Rev Econ Stud, 68, pp. 633-663; Straumann, D., Mikosch, T., Quasi-MLE in heteroscedastic time series: a stochastic recurrence equations approach (2006) Ann Stat, 34, pp. 2449-2495; Taylor, S.J., (2005) Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction, , Princeton: Princeton University Press",English,Article

Using the QR decomposition of a matrix, the moments of random individual effects and errors are estimated without affecting each other so that the estimation procedure is simple to implement, and the asymptotic behavior of estimation is derived. On the basis of these estimations, we construct a test for the existence of individual effects. This test is asymptotically normally distributed under the null hypothesis without any distributional assumptions on the individual effects and errors other than moments. A power study shows that our test is able to detect local alternatives that are distinct from the null at a parametric rate.

The focus is on generalized autoregressive models where the autoregressive structure is incorporated via a link function. Starting from an ordinary autoregressive model the difficulties in extending standard theory of statistical inference to count time series are highlighted. Special attention is given to the issues of ergodicity and asymptotic theory of estimation. Two main approaches are mentioned, a perturbation approach and the use of a weak dependence concept. The main emphasis is on the former. Linear as well as log-linear and nonlinear models are treated. It is argued that the developed theory forms a necessary basis for modelling and application of these count time series. The setting of the paper is one of simple models and conditional distributions of Poisson type. But it is claimed that the framework is general enough to handle many extensions with an accompanying flexibility in applications of these models. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Autoregressive; Count time series; Maximum likelihood; Perturbation; Weak dependence,,"Andrews, D.W.K., Non-strong mixing autoregressive processes (1984) Journal of Applied Probability, pp. 930-934; Berkes, I., Horváth, L., Kokoszka, P., GARCH processes: structure and estimation (2003) Bernoulli, 9 (2), pp. 201-227; Bickel, P.J., Bühlmann, P., A new mixing notion and functional central limit theorems for a sieve bootstrap in time series (1999) Bernoulli, 5 (3), pp. 413-446; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., (1987) Time Series: Theory and Methods, , Berlin: Springer; Cox, D.R., Statistical analysis of time series: Some recent developments [with discussion and reply] (1981) Scand J Stat, 8 (2), pp. 93-115; Cui, Y., Lund, R., A new look at time series of counts (2009) Biometrika, 96 (4), pp. 781-792; Czado, C., Gneiting, T., Held, L., Predictive model assessment for count data (2009) Biometrics, 65 (4), pp. 1254-1261; Davis, R.A., Dunsmuir, W., Streett, S.B., Observation-driven models for Poisson counts (2003) Biometrika, 90 (4), pp. 777-790; Dedecker, J., Prieur, C., New dependence coefficients.

These extremal events are useful and widely used in literature but an adverse situation may also occur with the upcrossing of a high level. In this context we define upcrossings-tail dependence coefficients and analyze all types of dependence coming out. We will prove that these coefficients are related to multivariate tail dependence coefficients already known in literature. We shall see that the upcrossings-tail dependence coefficients have the interesting feature of congregating both ""temporal"" and ""spatial"" dependence. The coefficients of tail dependence can also be applied to stationary sequences and hence measure the tail dependence in time. Results concerning connections with the extremal index and the upcrossings index as well as with local dependence conditions will be stated. Several illustrative examples will be exploited and a small note on inference will be given by presenting estimators derived from the stated results and respective properties. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic independence; Extreme values; Measures of tail dependence,,"Alpuim, M.T., An extremal markovian sequence (1989) J Appl Probab, 26, pp. 219-232; Ancona-Navarrete, M.A., Tawn, J.A., A comparison of methods for estimating the extremal index (2000) Extremes, 3, pp. 5-38; Billingsley, P., (1968) Convergence of Probability Measures, , New York: Wiley; Canto e Castro, L., (1992) Sobre a teoria assintótica de extremos, , PhD thesis, FCUL; Coles, S., Heffernan, J., Tawn, J.A., Dependence measures for extreme value analyses (1999) Extremes, 2, pp. 339-365; Chernick, M.R., Hsing, T., McCormick, W.P., Calculating the extremal index for a class of stationary sequences (1991) Adv Appl Probab, 23, pp. 835-850; Draisma, G., Duration of extremes at sea (2001) Parametric and semi-parametric methods in E.

"Russo C.M., Aoki R., Paula G.A.",Assessment of variance components in nonlinear mixed-effects elliptical models,2012,Test,519,545,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84866085859&partnerID=40&md5=5a23fd94096b5f2499463afb7f1edcab,"The issue of assessing variance components is essential in deciding on the inclusion of random effects in the context of mixed models. In this work we discuss this problem by supposing nonlinear elliptical models for correlated data by using the score-type test proposed in Silvapulle and Silvapulle (1995). Being asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio test and only requiring the estimation under the null hypothesis, this test provides a fairly easy computable alternative for assessing one-sided hypotheses in the context of the marginal model. Taking into account the possible non-normal distribution, we assume that the joint distribution of the response variable and the random effects lies in the elliptical class, which includes light-tailed and heavy-tailed distributions such as Student-t, power exponential, logistic, generalized Student-t, generalized logistic, contaminated normal, and the normal itself, among others. We compare the sensitivity of the score-type test under normal, Student-t and power exponential models for the kinetics data set discussed in Vonesh and Carter (1992) and fitted using the model presented in Russo et al. (2009). Also, a simulation study is performed to analyze the consequences of the kurtosis misspecification. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Elliptical distributions; Hypothesis testing; Nonlinear models; Score tests; Variance components,,"Cysneiros, F.J.A., Paula, G.A., Restricted methods in symmetrical linear regression models (2005) Comput Stat Data Anal, 49, pp. 689-708; Giampaoli, V., Singer, J.M., Likelihood ratio tests for variance components in linear mixed models (2009) J Stat Plan Inference, 139, pp. 1435-1448; Gómez, E., Gómez-Villegas, M.A., Martín, J.M., A multivariate generalization of the power exponential family of distributions (1998) Commun Stat, Theory Methods, 27, pp. 589-600; Lange, K.L., Little, R.J.A., Taylor, J.M.G., Robust statistical modeling using the t-distribution (1989) J Am Stat Assoc, 84, pp. 881-896; Li, Z., Zhu, L., On variance components in semiparametric mixed models for longitudinal data (2010) Scand J Stat, 37, pp. 442-457; Magnus, J.R., Vasnev, A.L., Local sensitivity and diagnostic tests (2007) Econom J, 10, pp. 166-192; Meza, C., Osorio, F., de la Cruz, R., Estimation in nonlinear mixed-effects models using heavy-tailed distributions (2010) Stat Comput, , doi:10.1007/s11222-010-9212-1; Osorio, F., Paula, G.A., Galea, M., Assessment of local influence in elliptical linear models with longitudinal structure (2007) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51, pp. 4354-4368; Patriota, A.G., A note on influence diagnostics in nonlinear mixed-effects elliptical models (2011) Comput Stat Data Anal, 55, pp. 218-225; Russo, C.M., Paula, G.A., Aoki, R., Influence diagnostics in nonlinear mixed-effects elliptical models (2009) Comput Stat Data Anal, 53, pp. 4143-4156; Russo, C.M., (2010) Modelos não lineares elípticos para dados correlacionados, , PhD thesis, Instituto de Matemática e Estatística, Universidade de São Paulo (in Portuguese); Savalli, C., Paula, G.A., Cysneiros, F.J.A., Assessment of variance components in elliptical linear mixed models (2006) Stat Model, 6, pp. 59-76; Shapiro, A., Asymptotic distribution of test statistics in the analysis of moment structures under inequality constraints (1985) Biometrika, 72 (1), pp. 133-144; Silvapulle, M.J., Silvapulle, P., A score test against one-sided alternatives (1995) J Am Stat Assoc, 90, pp. 342-349; Verbeke, G., Molenberghs, G., The use of score tests for inference on variance components (2003) Biometrics, 59, pp. 254-262; Vonesh, E.F., Carter, R.L., Mixed-effects nonlinear regression for unbalanced repeated measures (1992) Biometrics, 48, pp. 1-17; Vu, H.T.V., Zhou, S., Generalization of likelihood ratio tests under nonstandard conditions (1997) Ann Stat, 25 (2), pp. 897-916; Zhang, D., Lin, X., Variance component testing in generalized linear mixed models for longitudinal/clustered data and other related topics (2008) Random Effect and Latent Variable Model Selection, , Berlin: Springer",English,Article

The Voronoi cell of s with respect to T consists of all points closer to s than to any other site. In many real applications, the position of some elements of T is uncertain due to either random external causes or to measurement errors. In this paper we analyze the effect on the Voronoi cell of small changes in s or in a given non-empty set P⊂T\{s}. Two types of perturbations of P are considered, one of them not increasing the cardinality of T. More in detail, the paper provides conditions for the corresponding Voronoi cell mappings to be closed, lower and upper semicontinuous.

In our problem, the fixed-order cost of each agent is the sum of a first component (common to all agents) plus a second component which depends on the distance from the agent to the supplier. We assume that agents are located on a line route, in the sense that if any subgroup of agents places a joint order, its fixed cost is the sum of the first component plus the second component of the agent in the group at maximal distance from the supplier. For these inventory transportation systems, we introduce and characterize a rule which allows us to allocate the costs generated by the joint order. This rule has the same flavor as the Shapley value, but requires less computational effort. We show that our rule has good properties from the point of view of stability. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cooperative games; Core; Cost allocation rule; Inventory transportation systems,,"Anily, S., Haviv, M., The cost allocation problem for the first order interaction joint replenishment model (2007) Oper Res, 55, pp. 292-302; Dror, M., Hartman, B.C., Shipment consolidation: who pays for it and how much?

We work with certain exponential smoothing models, namely Holt's additive linear and Gardner's damped trend. We study some probability properties of those models, showing the influence of the initial conditions on the forecast, which highlights the importance of obtaining accurate estimates of initial conditions. Using the linear heteroscedastic modeling approach, we show how to obtain the joint estimation of initial conditions and smoothing parameters through maximum likelihood via box-constrained nonlinear optimization. Point-wise forecasts of future values and prediction intervals are computed under normality assumptions on the stochastic component. We also propose an alternative formulation of prediction intervals in order to obtain an empirical coverage closer to their nominal values; that formulation adds an additional term to the standard formulas for the estimation of the error variance. We illustrate the proposed approach by using the yearly data time-series from the M3-Competition. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Damped trend models; Demand forecasting; Exponential smoothing; M3-Competition; Prediction intervals,,"Arnold, J.R.T., Chapman, S.N., Clive, L.M., (2008) Introduction to Materials Management, , 6th edn., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Prentice Hall; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., Improving demand forecasting accuracy using non-linear programming software (2006) J Oper Res Soc, 57, pp. 94-100; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., A decision support system methodology for forecasting of time series based on soft computing (2006) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51, pp. 177-191; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., Holt-Winters forecasting: an alternative formulation applied to UK air passenger data (2007) J Appl Stat, 34, pp. 1075-1090; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., SIOPRED: a prediction and optimisation integrated system for demand (2008) Top, 16, pp. 258-271; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., Bayesian forecasting with the Holt-Winters modes (2010) J Oper Res Soc, 61, pp. 164-171; Byrd, R.H., Lu, P., Nocedal, J., Zhu, C., A limited memory algorithm for bound constrained optimization (1995) SIAM J Sci Comput, 16, pp. 1190-1208; Corberán-Vallet, A., Bermúdez, J.D., Vercher, E., Forecasting correlated time series with exponential smoothing models (2011) Int J Forecast, 27, pp. 252-265; Fildes, R., Kingsman, B., Incorporating demand uncertainty and forecast error in supply chain planning models (2011) J Oper Res Soc, 62, pp. 483-500; Fildes, R., Nikolopoulos, K., Crone, S.F., Syntetos, A.A., Forecasting and operational research: a review (2008) J Oper Res Soc, 59, pp. 1150-1172; Gardner Jr., E.S., Exponential smoothing: the state of the art-part II (2006) Int J Forecast, 22, pp. 637-666; Gardner, E., McKenzie, E., Forecasting trends in time series (1985) Manag Sci, 31, pp. 1237-1246; Harvey, A., (1989) Forecasting, Structural Time Series Models and the Kalman Filter, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Hyndman, R.J., Koehler, A.B., Another look at measures of forecast accuracy (2006) Int J Forecast, 22, pp. 679-688; Hyndman, R.J., Koehler, A.B., Ord, J.K., Snyder, R.D., Prediction intervals for exponential smoothing using two new classes of state space models (2005) J Forecast, 24, pp. 17-37; Hyndman, R.J., Koehler, A.B., Ord, J.K., Snyder, R.D., (2008) Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing.

Parameter perturbations on the right-hand side of the inequalities are required to be merely bounded, and thus the natural parameter space is l ∞(J). Our basic strategy consists of linearizing the parameterized convex system via splitting convex inequalities into linear ones by using the Fenchel-Legendre conjugate. This approach yields that arbitrary bounded right-hand side perturbations of the convex system turn on constant-by-blocks perturbations in the linearized system. Based on advanced variational analysis, we derive a precise formula for computing the exact Lipschitzian bound of the feasible solution map of block-perturbed linear systems, which involves only the system's data, and then show that this exact bound agrees with the coderivative norm of the aforementioned mapping. In this way we extend to the convex setting the results of Cánovas et al. (SIAM J. Optim. 20, 1504-1526, 2009) developed for arbitrary perturbations with no block structure in the linear framework under the boundedness assumption on the system's coefficients. The latter boundedness assumption is removed in this paper when the decision space is reflexive.

The cuts are identified by solving the auxiliary submodels attached to the scenarios. In this work, we propose the algorithm named scenario Cluster Benders Decomposition (CBD) for dealing with the feasibility cut identification in the Benders method for solving large-scale two-stage stochastic linear problems. The scenario tree is decomposed into a set of scenario clusters and tighter feasibility cuts are obtained by solving the auxiliary submodel for each cluster instead of each individual scenario. Then, the scenario cluster based scheme allows to identify tighter feasibility cuts that yield feasible second stage decisions in reasonable computing time. Some computational experience is reported by using CPLEX as the solver of choice for the auxiliary LP submodels at each iteration of the algorithm CBD. The results that are reported show the favorable performance of the new approach over the traditional single scenario based Benders decomposition; it also outperforms the plain use of CPLEX for medium-large and large size instances. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Benders decomposition; Scenario cluster auxiliary submodels; Tight feasibility cuts; Two-stage stochastic linear problems,,"Benders, J., Partitioning procedures for solving mixed variables programming problems (1962) Numer Math, 4, pp. 238-252; Birge, J.R., Decomposition and partitioning methods for multi-stage stochastic linear programs (1985) Oper Res, 33, pp. 989-1007; Birge, J.R., Louveaux, F., A multicut algorithm for two-stage stochastic linear programs (1988) Eur J Oper Res, 34, pp. 384-392; Birge, J.R., Louveaux, F., (1997) Introduction to Stochastic Programming, , Berlin: Springer; Dantzig, G.B., Wolfe, P., The decomposition principle for linear programs (1960) Oper Res, 8, pp. 101-111; Escudero, L.F., Garín, M.A., Merino, M., Pérez, G., A two-stage stochastic integer programming approach as a mixture of Branch-and-Fix Coordination and Benders Decomposition schemes (2007) Ann Oper Res, 152, pp. 395-420; Escudero, L.F., Garín, M.A., Merino, M., Pérez, G., A general algorithm for solving two-stage stochastic mixed 0-1 first stage problems (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36, pp. 2590-2600; Escudero, L.F., Garín, M.A., Merino, M., Pérez, G., An exact algorithm for solving large-scale two-stage stochastic mixed integer problems: Some theoretical and experimental aspects (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 204, pp. 105-116; (2009) IBM ILOG CPLEX v12.2, , http://www.ilog.com/products/cplex; (2010) Computational INfrastructure for Operations Research, , http://www.coin-or.org, INFORMS.

Here, clustering is performed by computing the Voronoi partition associated with centers that minimize an empirical criterion, called distorsion. The performance of the method is evaluated by comparing the theoretical distorsion of empirical optimal centers to the theoretical optimal distorsion. Our first result states that, provided that the underlying distribution satisfies an exponential moment condition, an upper bound for the above performance criterion is,. Then, motivated by a broad range of applications, we focus on the case where the data are real-valued random fields. Assuming that they share a Hölder property in quadratic mean, we construct a numerically simple k-means algorithm based on a discretized version of the data. With a judicious choice of the discretization, we prove that the performance of this algorithm matches the performance of the classical algorithm. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Clustering; Empirical risk minimization; Hilbert space; k-means; Random fields; Unsupervised learning,,"Abaya, E.A., Wise, G.L., Convergence of vector quantizers with applications to optimal quantization (1984) SIAM J Appl Math, pp. 183-189; Adamczak, R., A tail inequality for suprema of unbounded empirical processes with applications to Markov chains (2008) Electron J Probab, pp. 1000-1034; Antos, A., Improved minimax bounds on the test and training distortion of empirically designed vector quantizers (2005) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 4022-4032; Antos, A., Györfi, L., György, A., Improved convergence rates in empirical vector quantizer design (2005) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 4013-4022; Bartlett, P.L., Linder, T., Lugosi, G., The minimax distorsion redundancy in empirical quantizer design (1998) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 1802-1813; Biau, G., Devroye, L., Lugosi, G., On the performance of clustering in Hilbert spaces (2008) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 781-790; Breton, J.C., Nourdin, I., Peccati, G., Exact confidence intervals for the Hurst parameter of a fractional Brownian motion (2009) Electron J Stat, pp. 416-425; Chou, P.A., The distorsion of vector quantizers trained on n vectors decreases to the optimum at O P(1/n) (1994) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, p. 457; Coeurjolly, J.-F., Hurst exponent estimation of locally self-similar Gaussian processes using sample quantiles (2008) Ann Stat, pp. 1404-1434; Cont, R., Tankov, P., (2003) Financial Modelling with Jump Processes, , 2nd edn., London: Chapmann and Hall, CRC Press; Devroye, L., Györfi, L., Lugosi, G., (1996) A Probabilistic Theory of Pattern-Recognition, , New York: Springer; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Stork, D.G., (2000) Pattern Classification, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley-Interscience; Frisch, U., (1995) Turbulences, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Gersho, A., Gray, R.M., (1992) Vector Quantization and Signal Compression, , Boston: Kluwer Academic; Graf, S., Luschgy, H., (2000) Foundations of Quantization for Probability Distributions, 1730. , Lectures notes in mathematics, New York: Springer; Gray, R.M., Neuhoff, D.L., Quantization (1998) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 2325-2384; Hartigan, J.A., (1975) Clustering Algorithms, , New York: Wiley; Hartigan, J.A., Asymptotic distributions for clustering criteria (1978) Ann Stat, pp. 117-131; Huang, W., Exponential integrability of Itô's processes (2009) J Math Anal Appl, pp. 427-433; Kärner, O., Comments on Hurst exponent (2001) Geophys Res Lett, pp. 3825-3826; Kimmel, M., Axelrod, D.E., (2002) Branching Processes in Biology, , Berlin: Springer; Lacaux, C., Loubès, J.-M., Hurst exponent estimation of fractional Lévy motions (2007) Alea, pp. 143-164; Lamberton, D., Lapeyre, B., (1996) Introduction to Stochastic Calculus Applied to Finance, , London: Chapman and Hall, CRC Press; Linder, T., On the training distortion of vector quantizers (2000) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 1617-1623; Linder, T., (2001) Learning-Theoretic Methods in Vector Quantization, , Lecture notes for the advanced school on the principle of nonparametric learningUdine, Italy, July 9-13; Linder, T., Lugosi, G., Zeger, K., Rates of convergence in the source coding theorem, in empirical quantizer design, and in universal lossy source coding (1994) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, pp. 1728-1740; Lindstrøm, T., Fractional Brownian fields as integrals of white noise (1993) Bull Lond Math Soc, pp. 83-88; Mandelbrot, B., (1997) Fractals and Scaling in Finance, , Selected works of Benoit B.

Math. Anal. Appl. 305:644-658, 2005), the authors introduce the notion of h-integrability of an array of random variables with respect to an array of constants, and obtained some mean convergence theorems for weighted sums of random variables subject to some special kinds of dependence. In view of the important role played by conditioning and dependence in the models used to describe many situations in the applied sciences, the concepts and results in the aforementioned paper are extended herein to the case of randomly weighted sums of dependent random variables when a sequence of conditioning sigma-algebras is given. The dependence conditions imposed on the random variables (conditional negative quadrant dependence and conditional strong mixing) as well as the convergence results obtained are conditional relative to the conditioning sequence of sigma-algebras. In the last section, a strong conditional convergence theorem is also established by using a strong notion of conditional h-integrability. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Conditional negative dependence; Conditional residual h-integrability; Conditional strong-mixing; Conditional strongly residual h-integrability; Randomly weighted sums,,"Aas, K., Czado, C., Frigessi, A., Bakken, H., Pair-copula constructions of multiple dependence (2009) Insur Math Econ, 44, pp. 182-198; Basawa, I.V., Prakasa Rao, B.L.S., (1980) Statistical Inference for Stochastic Processes, , London: Academic Press; Chandra, T.K., Goswami, A., Cesàro α-integrability and laws of large numbers I (2003) J Theor Probab, 16, pp. 655-669; Chandra, T.K., Goswami, A., Cesàro α-integrability and laws of large numbers-II (2006) J Theor Probab, 19, pp. 789-816; Chow, Y.S., Teicher, H., (1997) Probability Theory: Independence, Interchangeability, Martingales, , 3rd edn., xxii+488 pp, New York: Springer; Leek, J.T., Asymptotic conditional singular value decomposition for high-dimensional genomic data (2011) Biometrics, , doi: 10. 1111/j. 1541-0420. 2010. 01455. x; Lehmann, E.L., Some concepts of dependence (1966) Ann Math Stat, 37, pp. 1137-1153; Ordóñez, C.M., Convergence of weighted sums of random variables and uniform integrability concerning the weights (1994) Collect Math, 45, pp. 121-132; Ordóñez, C.M., Volodin, A.I., Mean convergence theorems and weak laws of large numbers for weighted sums of random variables under a condition of weighted integrability (2005) J Math Anal Appl, 305, pp. 644-658; Prakasa Rao, B.L.S., Conditional independence, conditional mixing and conditional association (2009) Ann Inst Stat Math, 61, pp. 441-460; Rosenblatt, M., A central limit theorem and a strong mixing condition (1956) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 42, pp. 43-47; Roussas, G.G., On conditional independence, mixing, and association (2008) Stoch Anal Appl, 26, pp. 1274-1309; Shen, X., Lin, Z., Zhang, Y., Uniform estimate for maximum of randomly weighted sums with applications to ruin theory (2009) Methodol Comput Appl Probab, 11, pp. 669-685; Sheremet, O., Lucas, A., Global loss diversification in the insurance sector (2009) Insur Math Econ, 44, pp. 415-425; Wang, D., Tang, Q., Tail probabilities of randomly weighted sums of random variables with dominated variation (2006) Stoch Models, 22, pp. 253-272; Weng, C., Zhang, Y., Tan, K.S., Ruin probabilities in a discrete time risk model with dependent risks of heavy tail (2009) Scand Actuar J, 3, pp. 205-218; Yuan, D., Tao, B., Mean convergence theorems for weighted sums of arrays of residually h-integrable random variables concerning the weights under dependence assumptions (2008) Acta Appl Math, 103, pp. 221-234",English,Article

Conditional independences are captured by what we name regression graphs, provided the generated distribution shares some properties with a joint Gaussian distribution. Regression graphs extend purely directed, acyclic graphs by two types of undirected graph, one type for components of joint responses and the other for components of the context vector variable. We review the special features and the history of regression graphs, prove criteria for Markov equivalence and discuss the notion of a simpler statistical covering model. Knowledge of Markov equivalence provides alternative interpretations of a given sequence of regressions, is essential for machine learning strategies and permits to use the simple graphical criteria of regression graphs on graphs for which the corresponding criteria are in general more complex. Under the known conditions that a Markov equivalent directed acyclic graph exists for any given regression graph, we give a polynomial time algorithm to find one such graph. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Chain graphs; Concentration graphs; Covariance graphs; Graphical Markov models; Independence graphs; Intervention models; Labelled trees; Lattice conditional independence models; Structural equation models,,"Ali, R.A., Richardson, T.S., Spirtes, P., Markov equivalence for ancestral graphs (2009) Ann Stat, 37, pp. 2808-2837; Anderson, T.W., (1958) An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , (3rd edn, 2003), New York: Wiley; Anderson, T.W., Asymptotically efficient estimation of covariance matrices with linear structure (1973) Ann Stat, 1, pp. 135-141; Andersson, S.A., Perlman, M.D., Characterizing Markov equivalence classes for AMP chain graph (2006) Ann Stat, 34, pp. 939-972; Andersson, S.A., Madigan, D., Perlman, M.D., Triggs, C.M., A graphical characterization of lattice conditional independence models (1997) Ann Math Artif Intell, 21, pp. 27-50; Andersson, S.A., Madigan, D., Perlman, M.D., Alternative Markov properties for chain graphs (2001) Scand J Stat, 28, pp. 33-86; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., (1978) Information and Exponential Families in Statistical Theory, , Chichester: Wiley; Bergsma, W., Rudas, T., Marginal models for categorical data (2002) Ann Stat, 30, pp. 140-159; Birch, M.W., Maximum likelihood in three-way contingency tables (1963) J R Stat Soc B, 25, pp. 220-233; Bishop, Y.M.M., Fienberg, S.F., Holland, P.W., (1975) Discrete Multivariate Analysis, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Blair, J.R.S., Peyton, B.W., An introduction to chordal graphs and clique trees (1993) Graph Theory and Sparse Matrix Computations, 56, pp. 1-30. , IMA volumes in mathematics and its applications, J.

However, this model can face the so called ""curse of dimensionality"" problem that can be solved by imposing a nonparametric dependence on some unknown projection of the carriers. More precisely, we assume that the observations (y i,x i,t i),1≤i≤n, are such that t i∈ℝ q, x i∈ℝ p and y i{pipe}(x i,t i)~F({dot operator},μ i) with μ=(η(α Tt i+X i Tβ), for some known distribution function F and link function H. The function η:ℝ→ℝ and the parameters α and β are unknown and to be estimated. This model is known as the generalized partly linear single-index model. In this paper, we introduce a family of robust estimates for the parametric and nonparametric components under a generalized partially linear single-index model. It is shown that the estimates of α and β are root-n consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Through a Monte Carlo study, we compare the performance of the proposed estimators with that of the classical ones. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic properties; Generalized partly linear single-index models; Rate of convergence; Robust estimation; Smoothing techniques,,"Azadeh, A., Salibian-Barrera, M., An outlier-robust fit for generalised additive models with applications to outbreak detection (2011) J Am Stat Assoc, , http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~matias/rgam-rev1-authors.pdf, Available at; Bianco, A., Boente, G., On the asymptotic behavior of one-step estimation (2002) Stat Probab Lett, 60, pp. 33-47; Bianco, A., Yohai, V., Robust estimation in the logistic regression model (1995) Lecture Notes in Statistics, 109, pp. 17-34. , New York: Springer; Bianco, A., García, B.M., Yohai, V., Robust estimation for linear regression with asymmetric errors (2005) Can J Stat, 33, pp. 511-528; Boente, G., Rodriguez, D., Robust inference in generalized partially linear models (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 2942-2966; Boente, G., He, X., Zhou, J., Robust estimates in generalized partially linear models (2006) Ann Stat, 34, pp. 2856-2878; Cantoni, E., Ronchetti, E., Robust inference for generalized linear models (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96, pp. 1022-1030; Carroll, R., Fan, J., Gijbels, I., Wand, M., Generalized partially linear single-index models (1997) J Am Stat Assoc, 92, pp. 477-489; Croux, C., Haesbroeck, G., Implementing the Bianco and Yohai estimator for logistic regression (2002) Comput Stat Data Anal, 44, pp. 273-295; Delecroix, M., Härdle, W., Hristache, M., Efficient estimation in conditional single-index regression (2003) J Multivar Anal, 86, pp. 213-226; Friedman, J., Stuetzle, W., Projection pursuit regression (1981) J Am Stat Assoc, 76, pp. 817-823; Härdle, W., Mammen, E., Müller, M., Testing parametric versus semiparametric modeling in generalized linear models (1998) J Am Stat Assoc, 93, pp. 1461-1474; Härdle, W., Müller, M., Sperlich, S., Werwatz, A., (2006) Nonparametric and Semiparametric Models, , Berlin: Springer; Hastie, T.J., Tibshirani, R.J., (1990) Generalized Additive Models, , New York: Chapman & Hall, CRC; He, X., Zhu, Z., Fung, W., Estimation in a semiparametric model for longitudinal data with unspecified dependence structure (2002) Biometrika, 89, pp. 579-590; Künsch, H., Stefanski, L., Carroll, R., Conditionally unbiased bounded influence estimation in general regression models with applications to generalized linear models (1989) J Am Stat Assoc, 84, pp. 460-466; McCullagh, P., Nelder, J., (1989) Generalized Linear Models, , 2nd edn., London: Champman and Hall; Pollard, D., (1984) Convergence of Stochastic Processes, , Springer series in statistics, New York: Springer; Robinson, P., Root-n consistent semiparametric regression (1988) Econometrica, 56, pp. 931-954; Rodriguez, D., (2008) Doctoral thesis, Universidad de Buenos Aires, , http://cms.dm.uba.ar/academico/carreras/doctorado/tesisdanielarodriguez.pdf, Available at; Severini, T., Staniswalis, J., Quasi-likelihood estimation in semiparametric models (1994) J Am Stat Assoc, 89, pp. 501-511; Severini, T., Wong, W., Profile likelihood and conditionally parametric models (1992) Ann Stat, 20 (4), pp. 1768-1802; Stefanski, L., Carroll, R., Ruppert, D., Bounded score functions for generalized linear models (1986) Biometrika, 73, pp. 413-424; van der Vaart, A., Estimating a real parameter in a class of semiparametric models (1988) Ann Stat, 16 (4), pp. 1450-1474; Wang, J.L., Xue, L., Zhu, L., Chong, Y., Estimation for a partial-linear single-index model (2010) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 246-274; Xia, Y., Härdle, W., Semi-parametric estimation of partially linear single-index models (2006) J Multivar Anal, 97, pp. 1162-1184; Xia, Y., Tong, H., Li, W.K., On extended partially linear single-index models (1999) Biometrika, 86, pp. 831-842; Yi, G.Y., He, W., Liang, H., Analysis of correlated binary data under partially linear single-index logistic models (2009) J Multivar Anal, 100, pp. 278-290",English,Article

In this work we assume that all distributions are stationary ergodic and do not make any further assumptions (in particular, no independence or mixing rate assumptions). We find some necessary and some sufficient conditions, formulated in terms of the topological properties of H 0 and H 1, for the existence of a consistent test. For the case where H 1 is the complement of H 0 (to the set of all stationary ergodic processes), these necessary and sufficient conditions coincide, thereby providing a complete characterization of families of processes membership to which can be consistently tested, against their complement, based on sampling. This criterion includes as special cases several known and some new results on testing for membership to various parametric families, as well as testing identity, independence, and other hypotheses. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Distributional distance; Hypothesis testing; Property testing; Stationary ergodic time series,,"Anderson, T., Goodman, L., Statistical inference about Markov chains (1957) Ann Math Stat, 28 (1), pp. 89-110; Biau, G., Gyorfi, L., On the asymptotic properties of a nonparametric l 1-test of homogeneity (2005) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 51, pp. 3965-3973; Billingsley, P., Statistical inference about Markov chains (1961) Ann Math Stat, 32 (1), pp. 12-40; Billingsley, P., (1965) Ergodic Theory and Information, , New York: Wiley; Csiszar, I., Information-type measures of difference of probability distributions and indirect observations (1967) Studia Sci Math Hung, 2, pp. 299-318; Csiszar, I., Shields, P., The consistency of the BIC Markov order estimator (2000) Ann Stat, 28 (6), pp. 1601-1619; Csiszar, I., Shields, P., Notes on information theory and statistics (2004) Foundations and Trends in Communications and Information Theory; Gray, R., (1988) Probability, Random Processes, and Ergodic Properties, , Berlin: Springer; Gretton, A., Györfi, L., Consistent nonparametric tests of independence (2010) J Mach Learn Res, 11, pp. 1391-1423; Kendall, M., Stuart, A., The advanced theory of statistics (1961) Inference and relationship, 2. , London (1961); Kieffer, J., Strongly consistent code-based identification and order estimation for constrained finite-state model classes (1993) IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 39 (3), pp. 893-902; Lehmann, E., (1986) Testing Statistical Hypotheses, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Morvai, G., Weiss, B., On classifying processes (2005) Bernoulli, 11 (3), pp. 523-532; Ryabko, B., Astola, J., Universal codes as a basis for time series testing (2006) Stat Methodol, 3, pp. 375-397; Ryabko, B., Astola, J., Gammerman, A., Application of Kolmogorov complexity and universal codes to identity testing and nonparametric testing of serial independence for time series (2006) Theor Comput Sci, 359, pp. 440-448; Ryabko, D., Clustering processes (2010) Proc the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2000), pp. 919-926. , Haifa, Israel; Ryabko, D., Discrimination between B-processes is impossible (2010) J Theor Probab, 23 (2), pp. 565-575; Ryabko, D., Testing composite hypotheses about discrete-valued stationary processes (2010) Proc.

This event may occur more than once for the same individual (recurrent event). We then have a scenario of recurrent event data in the presence of a cure fraction, which may appear in various areas such as oncology, finance, industries, among others. This paper proposes a multiple time scale survival model to analyze recurrent events using a cure fraction. The objective is analyzing the efficiency of certain interventions so that the studied event will not happen again in terms of covariates and censoring. All estimates were obtained using a sampling-based approach, which allows information to be input beforehand with lower computational effort. Simulations were done based on a clinical scenario in order to observe some frequentist properties of the estimation procedure in the presence of small and moderate sample sizes.

We have examined testing the null hypothesis of equality of mean for detecting differentially expressed genes. The p-value for each gene is often estimated using permutation samples not only for the target gene but also for other genes. This method has been widely used and discussed. However, direct use of the permutation method for the p-value estimation may not work well, because two types of genes are mixed in the sample; some genes are differentially expressed, whereas others are not. To overcome this difficulty, various methods for appropriately generating null permutation samples have been proposed. In this paper, we consider two classes of test statistics that are naturally modified to null statistics. We then obtain the uniformly most powerful (UMP) unbiased tests among these classes. If the underlying distribution is symmetric, the UMP unbiased test statistic is similar to that proposed by Pan (Bioinformatics 19:1333-1340, 2003). Under another condition, the UMP unbiased test statistic has a different formula with one more degree of freedom and therefore is expected to give a more powerful test and a more accurate p-value estimation from a modified null statistic. In microarray data, because the number of replicates is often small, differences in the degree of freedom will produce large effects on the power of test and the variance of the p-value estimation. Some simulation studies and real data analyses are illustrated to investigate the performances of the methods. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Microarray data; Multiple test; Null statistic; Small sample; Uniformly most powerful unbiased test,,"Azzalini, A., A class of distributions which includes the normal ones (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Choe, S.E., Boutros, M., Michelson, A.M., Church, G.M., Halfon, M.S., Preferred analysis methods for Affymetrix GeneChips revealed by a wholly defined control dataset (2005) Genome Biol, 6, pp. R16; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R., Storey, J.D., Tusher, V., Empirical Bayes analysis of a microarray experiment (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96, pp. 1151-1160; Gao, X., Construction of null statistics in permutation-based multiple testing for multi-factorial microarray experiments (2006) Bioinformatics, 22, pp. 1486-1494; Gottardo, R., Raftery, A.E., Ky, Y., Bumgarner, R.E., Bayesian robust inference for differential gene expression in microarrays with multiple samples (2006) Biometrics, 62, pp. 10-18; Ito, K., Schull, W.J., On the robustness of the T 2 0test in multivariate analysis of variance when variance-covariance matrices are not equal (1964) Biometrika, 51, pp. 71-82; Lehmann, E.L., Romano, J.P., (2005) Testing Statistical Hypotheses, , 3rd edn., Springer texts in statistics, New York: Springer; Lockhart, D., Dong, B., Byrne, M., Follettie, M., Gallo, M., Chee, M., Mittman, M., Expression monitoring by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays (1996) Nat Biotechnol, 14, pp. 1675-1680; McLachlan, G., Bean, R., Jones, L.B.T., A simple implementation of a normal mixture approach to differential gene expression in multiclass microarrays (2006) Bioinformatics, 22, pp. 1608-1615; Pan, W., On the use of permutation in and the performance of a class of nonparametric methods to detect differential gene expression (2003) Bioinformatics, 19, pp. 1333-1340; Pan, W., Lin, J., Le, C.T., A mixture model approach to detecting differentially expressed genes with microarray data (2003) Funct Integr Genomics, 3, pp. 117-124; Scheid, S., Spang, R., (2006) Permutation Filtering: A Novel Concept for Significance Analysis of Large-Scale Genomic Data, 3909, pp. 338-347. , Lecture notes comput sci; Scheid, S., Spang, R., Compensating for unknown confounders in microarray data analysis using filtered permutations (2007) J Comput Biol, 14, pp. 669-681; Southworth, L.K., Kim, S.K., Owen, A.B., Properties of balanced permutations (2009) J Comput Biol, 16, pp. 625-638; Storey, J.D., A direct approach to false discovery rates (2002) J R Stat Soc B, 64, pp. 479-498; Storey, J.D., Tibshirani, R., Statistical significance for genomewide studies (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 9440-9445; Tusher, V., Tibshirani, R., Chu, G., Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 98, pp. 5116-5121; van't Wout, A.B., Lehrman, G.K., Mikheeva, S.A., O'Keeffe, G.C., Katze, M.G., Bumgarner, R.E., Geiss, G.K., Mullins, J.I., Cellular gene expression upon human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection of CD4 +-T-cell lines (2003) J Virol, 77, pp. 1392-1402; Xie, Y., Pan, W., Khodursky, A.B., A note on using permutation-based false discovery rate estimates to compare different analysis methods for microarray data (2005) Bioinformatics, 21, pp. 4280-4288; Xu, J., Cui, X., Robustified MANOVA with applications in detecting differentially expressed genes from oligonucleotide arrays (2008) Bioinformatics, 24, pp. 1056-1062; Zhao, Y., Pan, W., Modified nonparametric approaches to detecting differentially expressed genes in replicated microarray experiments (2003) Bioinformatics, 19, pp. 1046-1054",English,Article

We investigate the use of derivative-free models based on radial basis functions (RBFs) in the search step of direct-search methods of directional type. We also study the application of algorithms based on difference of convex (d. c.) functions programming to solve the resulting subproblems which consist of the minimization of the RBF models subject to simple bounds on the variables. Extensive numerical results are reported with a test set of bound and linearly constrained problems. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",d.c. programming; DCA; Derivative-free optimization; Direct-search methods; Global optimization; Radial basis functions; Search step,,"Ali, M.M., Khompatraporn, C., Zabinsky, Z.B., A numerical evaluation of several stochastic algorithms on selected continuous global optimization test problems (2005) J Glob Optim, 31, pp. 635-672; Le Thi, H.A., Pham Dinh, T., Convex analysis approach to d.c. programming: theory, algorithms and applications (1997) Acta Math Vietnam, 22, pp. 289-355; Le Thi, H.A., Pham Dinh, T., D.C. optimization algorithms for solving the trust-region subproblem (1998) SIAM J Optim, 8, pp. 476-505; Le Thi, H.A., Pham Dinh, T., The DC (difference of convex functions) programming and DCA revisited with DC models of real world nonconvex optimization problems (2005) Ann Oper Res, 133, pp. 23-46; Björkman, M., Holmström, K., Global optimization of costly nonconvex functions using radial basis functions (2000) Optim Eng, 1, pp. 373-397; Conn, A.R., Scheinberg, K., Vicente, L.N., (2009) Introduction to Derivative-Free Optimization, , MPS-SIAM series on optimization, Philadelphia: SIAM; Dolan, E.D., Moré, J.J., Benchmarking optimization software with performance profiles (2002) Math Program, 91, pp. 201-213; Fourer, R., Gay, D.M., Kernighan, B.W., A modeling language for mathematical programming (1990) Manag Sci, 36, pp. 519-554; Griffin, J.D., Kolda, T.G., Asynchronous parallel hybrid optimization combining DIRECT and GSS (2010) Optim Methods Softw, 25, pp. 797-817; Gutmann, H.-M., A radial basis function method for global optimization (2001) J Glob Optim, 19, pp. 201-227; Hedar, A.-R., Fukushima, M., Heuristic pattern search and its hybridization with simulated annealing for nonlinear global optimization (2004) Optim Methods Softw, 19, pp. 291-308; Ingber, L., Rosen, B., Genetic algorithms and very fast simulated reannealing: a comparison (1992) Math Comput Model, 16, pp. 87-100; Ji, Y., Zhang, K.-C., Qu, S.-J., A deterministic global optimization algorithm (2006) Appl Math Comput, 185, pp. 382-387; Jones, D., Perttunen, C., Stuckman, B., Lipschitzian optimization without the Lipschitz constant (1993) J Optim Theory Appl, 79, pp. 157-181; Käck, J.-E., (2004) Constrained global optimization with radial basis functions, , Technical report research report MdH-IMa-2004, Department of Mathematics and Physics, Mälardalen University, Västerås, Sweden; Kiseleva, E., Stepanchuk, T., On the efficiency of a global non-differentiable optimization algorithm based on the method of optimal set partitioning (2003) J Glob Optim, 25, pp. 209-235; Kolda, T.G., Lewis, R.M., Torczon, V., Optimization by direct search: new perspectives on some classical and modern methods (2003) SIAM Rev, 45, pp. 385-482; Locatelli, M., A note on the Griewank test function (2003) J Glob Optim, 25, pp. 169-174; Locatelli, M., Schoen, F., Fast global optimization of difficult Lennard-Jones clusters (2002) Comput Optim Appl, 21, pp. 55-70; Michalewicz, Z., Evolutionary computation techniques for nonlinear programming problems (1994) Int Trans Oper Res, 1, pp. 223-240; Michalewicz, Z., (1996) Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs, , 3rd edn., Berlin: Springer; Mongeau, M., Karsenty, H., Rouzé, V., Hiriart-Urruty, J.-B., Comparison of public-domain software for black box global optimization (2000) Optim Methods Softw, 13, pp. 203-226; Moré, J.J., Wild, S.M., Benchmarking derivative-free optimization algorithms (2009) SIAM J Optim, 20, pp. 172-191. , www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/dfo; Oeuvray, R., (2005) Trust-region methods based on radial basis functions with application to biomedical imaging, , PhD thesis, Institut de Mathématiques, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland; Oeuvray, R., Bierlaire, M., BOOSTERS: a derivative-free algorithm based on radial basis functions (2009) Int J Model Simul, 29, pp. 4634-4636; Parsopoulos, K.E., Plagianakos, V.P., Magoulas, G.D., Vrahatis, M.N., Stretching technique for obtaining global minimizers through particle swarm optimization (2001) Proc of the Particle Swarm Optimization Workshop, pp. 22-29. , Indianapolis, USA; Pham Dinh, T., Elbernoussi, S., Duality in d.c.

We give examples of GOVO problems that may be analyzed in the context of Piecewise-Smooth Optimization. Generalizations of algorithms that have been proved to be effective for proving special classes of GOVO problems are introduced. The case of Low Order-Value Optimization (LOVO) is considered as an example of GOVO in which one needs specialized algorithms with stronger convergence results. Applications of constrained LOVO problems and problems with OVO constraints are presented. The state-of-the-art of Protein Alignment problems from the LOVO point of view are discussed. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.,Applications; Nonlinear programming; Order-value optimization; Protein alignment,,"Andreani, R., Dunder, C., Martínez, J.M., Order-Value Optimization: formulation and solution by means of a primal Cauchy method (2003) Math Methods Oper Res, 58, pp. 387-399; Andreani, R., Dunder, C., Martínez, J.M., Nonlinear-programming reformulation of the Order-Value Optimization Problem (2005) Math Methods Oper Res, 61, pp. 365-384; Andreani, R., Martínez, J.M., Schuverdt, M.L., On the relation between the Constant Positive Linear Dependence condition and quasinormality constraint qualification (2005) J Optim Theory Appl, 125, pp. 473-485; Andreani, R., Martínez, J.M., Salvatierra, M., Yano, F.S., Quasi-Newton methods for Order-Value Optimization and Value-at-Risk calculations (2006) Pac J Optim, 2, pp. 11-33; Andreani, R., Birgin, E.G., Martínez, J.M., Schuverdt, M.L., On Augmented Lagrangian methods with general lower-level constraints (2007) SIAM J Optim, 18, pp. 1286-1309; Andreani, R., Martínez, J.M., Martínez, L., Trust-region superposition methods for Protein Alignment (2008) IMA J Numer Anal, 28, pp. 690-710; Andreani, R., Martínez, J.M., Martínez, L., Yano, F.S., Continuous Optimization methods for Structural Alignment (2008) Math Program, 112, pp. 93-124; Andreani, R., Martínez, J.M., Martínez, L., Yano, F.S., Low Order-Value Optimization and applications (2009) J Glob Optim, 43, pp. 1-10; (1999) Fuzzy Models and Algorithms for Pattern Recognition and Image Processing, , J.

Non-convexity of the sum of least-squares objective in parameter estimation problems may often lead to the presence of multiple local minima. Here, we focus on the spatial branch-and-bound algorithm for global optimization and experiment with one of its implementations, BARON (Sahinidis in J. Glob. Optim. 8(2):201-205, 1996), to solve parameter estimation problems. Through the explicit use of first-order optimality conditions, we are able to significantly expedite convergence to global optimality by strengthening the relaxation of the lower-bounding problem that forms a crucial part of the spatial branch-and-bound technique. We analyze the results obtained from 69 test cases taken from the statistics literature and discuss the successes and limitations of the proposed idea. In addition, we discuss software implementation for the automation of our strategy. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Global optimization; Nonlinear least-squares; Parameter estimation; Unconstrained optimization,,"Bao, X., Sahinidis, N.V., Tawarmalani, M., Multiterm polyhedral relaxations for nonconvex, quadratically constrained quadratic programs (2009) Optim Methods Softw, 24, pp. 485-504; Bard, Y., (1974) Nonlinear Parameter Estimation, , San Diego: Academic Press; Bates, D., Watts, D.G., (1988) Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications, , New York: Wiley; Bauer, C., Introduction to the GiNaC framework for symbolic computation within the C++ programming language (2002) J Symb Comput, 33, pp. 1-12; Concha, M.J., (1999) Personal communication; Csendes, T., Ratz, D., Subdivision direction selection in interval methods for global optimization (1997) SIAM J Numer Anal, 34, pp. 922-938; Draper, N.R., Smith, H., (1966) Applied Regression Analysis, , New York: Wiley; Esposito, W.R., Floudas, C.A., Global optimization in parameter estimation of nonlinear algebraic models via the error-in-variables approach (1998) Ind Eng Chem Res, 37, pp. 1841-1858; Gallant, A.R., (1987) Nonlinear Statistical Models, , New York: Wiley; Gau, C.Y., Stadtherr, M.A., New interval methodologies for reliable chemical process modeling (2002) Comput Chem Eng, 26, pp. 827-840; Hentenryck, P.V., Michel, L., Deville, Y., (1997) Numerica: A Modeling Language for Global Optimization, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Hooker, J., (2000) Logic-Based Methods for Optimization: Combining Optimization and Constraint Satisfaction, , New York: Wiley; Horst, R., Tuy, H., (1996) Global Optimization: Deterministic Approaches, , 3rd edn., Berlin: Springer; Huet, S., (1986) Statistical Tools for Nonlinear Regression: A Practical Guide with S-PLUS Examples, , New York: Springer; Kearfott, R.B., Rigorous global search: Continuous problems (1996) Nonconvex Optim Appl 13; Krǐvy, I., Tvrdic, J., Krpec, R., Stochastic algorithms in nonlinear regression (2000) Comput Stat Data Anal, 33, pp. 277-290; McCormick, G.P., (1983) Nonlinear Programming: Theory, Algorithms and Applications, , New York: Wiley; Meyer, R.R., Roth, P.M., Modified damped least squares: an algorithm for nonlinear estimation (1972) J Inst Math Appl, 9, pp. 218-233; Mittelmann, H.D., Pruessner, A., A server for automated performance analysis of benchmarking data (2006) Optim Methods Softw, 21, pp. 105-120; (2010) StRD nonlinear least squares regression databases, , http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/nls/nls_main.shtml, NIST, Available at; Nocedal, J., Wright, S.J., (2006) Global Optimization: Deterministic Approaches, , 3rd edn., Berlin: Springer; Ratkowsky, D.A., (1989) Nonlinear Regression Modelling, , New York: Dekker; Sahinidis, N.V., BARON: a general purpose global optimization software package (1996) J Glob Optim, 8 (2), pp. 201-205; Sahinidis, N.V., Tawarmalani, M., (2002) Convexification and Global Optimization in Continuous and Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic; Sahinidis, N.V., Tawarmalani, M., Accelerating branch-and-bound through a modeling language construct for relaxation-specific constraints (2005) J Glob Optim, 32, pp. 259-280; Seber, G.A.F., (1989) Nonlinear Regression, , New York: Wiley; Tawarmalani, M., Sahinidis, N.V., Convex extensions and convex envelopes of lower semi-continuous functions (2002) Math Program, 93, pp. 247-263; Tawarmalani, M., Sahinidis, N.V., Global optimization of mixed-integer nonlinear programs: a theoretical and computational study (2004) Math Program, 99, pp. 563-591; Tawarmalani, M., Sahinidis, N.V., A polyhedral branch-and-cut approach to global optimization (2005) Math Program, 103, pp. 225-249; Tawarmalani, M., Ahmed, S., Sahinidis, N.V., Product disaggregation and relaxations of mixed-integer rational programs (2002) Optim Eng, 3, pp. 281-303; Tranter, R.L., (2000) Design and Analysis in Chemical Research, , Boca Raton: Sheffield Academic Press; Tu, R., Zheng, Q., Integral global optimization method in statistical applications (1993) Comput Math Appl, 25, pp. 9-17; Vaia, A., (2003) Global optimization in least-squares problems in FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, , PhD thesis, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign",English,Article

Similarly to delayed relax-and-cut approaches, the procedure dynamically appends valid inequalities to the linear programming relaxation as induced by the Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT). A Lagrangian dual algorithm that is augmented with a primal solution recovery scheme is applied implicitly to a full or partial first-level RLT relaxation, where RLT constraints that are currently being violated by the primal estimate are dynamically generated within the Lagrangian dual problem, thus controlling the size of the dual space while effectively capturing the strength of the RLT-enhanced relaxation. We present a preliminary computational study to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Delayed relax-and-cut approach; Dynamic Lagrangian dual; Mixed-integer programming; Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT); Valid inequalities,,"Balas, E., Ceria, S., Cornuéjols, G., A lift-and-project cutting plane algorithm for mixed 0-1 programs (1993) Math Program, 58 (3), pp. 295-324; Balas, E., Ceria, S., Cornuéjols, G., Mixed integer 0-1 programming by lift-and-project in a branch-and-bound framework (1996) Manag Sci, 42 (9), pp. 1229-1246; Barahona, F., Anbil, R., The volume algorithm: Producing primal solutions with a subgradient method (2000) Math Program, 87, pp. 385-399; Camerini, P.M., Fratta, L., Maffioli, F., On improving relaxation methods by modified gradient techniques (1975) Math Program Stud, 3, pp. 26-34; Escudero, L.F., Guignard, M., Malik, K., A Lagrangian relax-and-cut approach for the sequential ordering problem with precedence relationships (1994) Ann Oper Res, 50, pp. 219-237; Fisher, M., The Lagrangian relaxation method for solving integer programming problems (1981) Manag Sci, 27 (1), pp. 1-18; Guignard, M., Efficient cuts in Lagrangean 'relax-and-cut' schemes (1998) Eur J Oper Res, 105 (1), pp. 216-223; Held, M., Wolfe, P., Crowder, H., Validation of subgradient optimization (1974) Math Program, 6, pp. 62-88; Kiwiel, K.C., Proximity control in bundle methods for convex nondifferentiable minimization (1990) Math Program, 46 (1-3), pp. 105-122; Larsson, T., Patriksson, M., Strömberg, A.-B., Ergodic, primal convergence in dual subgradient schemes for convex programming (1999) Math Program, 86, pp. 283-312; Lim, C., Sherali, H.D., Convergence and computational analyses for some variable target value and subgradient deflection methods (2006) Comput Optim Appl, 34 (3), pp. 409-428; Lim, C., Sherali, H.D., A trust region target value method for optimizing nondifferentiable Lagrangian duals of linear programs (2006) Math Methods Oper Res, 64 (1), pp. 33-53; Lovász, L., Schrijver, A., Cones of matrices and set-functions and 0-1 optimization (1991) SIAM J Optim, 1, pp. 166-190; Lucena, A., Steiner problem in graphs: Lagrangian relaxation and cutting planes (1992) COALA Bull, 21, pp. 2-8; Lucena, A., Non-delayed relax-and-cut algorithms (2005) Ann Oper Res, 140, pp. 375-410; Nemhauser, G.L., Wolsey, L.A., (1999) Integer and Combinatorial Optimization, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Nesterov, Y., Smooth minimization of non-smooth functions (2005) Math Program, 103, pp. 127-152; Polyak, B.T., A general method of solving extremum problems (1967) Sov Math Dokl, 8, pp. 593-597; Polyak, B.T., Minimization of unsmooth functionals (1969) USSR Comput Math Math Phys, 9, pp. 14-29; Shapiro, J.F., A survey of Lagrangean techniques for discrete optimization (1979) Ann Discrete Math, 5, pp. 113-138; Sherali, H.D., Adams, W.P., A hierarchy of relaxations between the continuous and convex hull representations for zero-one programming problems (1990) SIAM J Discrete Math, 3 (3), pp. 411-430; Sherali, H.D., Adams, W.P., A hierarchy of relaxations and convex hull characterizations for mixed-integer zero-one programming problems (1994) Discrete Appl Math, 52 (1), pp. 83-106; Sherali, H.D., Choi, G., Recovery of primal solutions when using subgradient optimization methods to solve Lagrangian duals of linear programs (1996) Oper Res Lett, 19 (3), pp. 105-113; Sherali, H.D., Lim, C., On embedding the Volume Algorithm in a variable target value method for solving Lagrangian relaxations of linear programs (2004) Oper Res Lett, 32 (5), pp. 455-462; Sherali, H.D., Lim, C., Enhancing Lagrangian dual optimization for linear programs by obviating nondifferentiability (2007) INFORMS J Comput, 19 (1), pp. 3-13; Sherali, H.D., Tuncbilek, C.H., A reformulation-convexification approach for solving nonconvex quadratic programming problems (1995) J Glob Optim, 7, pp. 1-31; Sherali, H.D., Tuncbilek, C.H., New Reformulation-Linearization/Convexification relaxations for univariate and multivariate polynomial programming problems (1997) Oper Res Lett, 21 (1), pp. 1-10; Sherali, H.D., Ulular, O., A primal-dual conjugate subgradient algorithm for specially structured linear and convex programming problems (1989) Appl Math Optim, 20, pp. 193-221; Sherali, H.D., Choi, G., Tuncbilek, C.H., A variable target value method for nondifferentiable optimization (2000) Oper Res Lett, 26 (1), pp. 1-8; Sherali, H.D., Smith, J.C., Adams, W.P., Reduced first-level representations via the reformulation-linearization technique: Results, counter-examples, and computations (2000) Discrete Appl Math, 101 (1), pp. 247-267; Shor, N.Z., (1985) Minimization Methods for Nondifferentiable Functions, , Berlin: Springer",English,Article

To approximate f * we proceed in two steps. First, we use the ""joint+marginal"" approach of Lasserre (SIAM J. Optim. 20:1995-2022, 2010) to approximate from above the function x{mapping}Φ(x)=sup {g(x,y): y∈Y x} by a polynomial Φ d≥Φ, of degree at most 2d, with the strong property that Φ d converges to Φ for the L 1-norm, as d→∞ (and in particular, almost uniformly for some subsequence (d ℓ), ℓ ∈ N). Therefore, to approximate f * one may wish to solve the polynomial optimization problem f d 0= min x∈X{f(x): Φ d (x) ≤ 0} via a (by now standard) hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations, and for increasing values of d. In practice d is fixed, small, and one relaxes the constraint Φ d≤0 to Φ d(x)≤ε with ε&gt;0, allowing us to change ε dynamically. As d increases, the limit of the optimal value f d ε is bounded above by f *+ε. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Min-max optimization; Polynomial optimization; Robust optimization; Semidefinite relaxations,,"Ash, R.B., (1972) Real Analysis and Probability, , Boston: Academic Press; Bhattacharjee, B., Green Jr., W.H., Barton, P.I., Interval methods for semi-infinite programs (2005) Comput Optim Appl, 30, pp. 63-93; Calafiore, G.C., Dabbene, F., A probabilistic analytic center cutting plane method for feasibility of uncertain LMIs (2007) Automatica, 43, pp. 2022-2033; Henrion, D., Lasserre, J.B., Lofberg, J., GloptiPoly 3: moments, optimization and semidefinite programming (2009) Optim Methods Softw, 24, pp. 761-779; Lasserre, J.B., Global optimization with polynomials and the problem of moments (2001) SIAM J Optim, 11, pp. 796-817; Lasserre, J.B., Convergent SDP-relaxations in polynomial optimization with sparsity (2006) SIAM J Optim, 17, pp. 822-843; Lasserre, J.B., (2009) Moments, Positive Polynomials and Their Applications, , London: Imperial College Press; Lasserre, J.B., A ""joint+marginal"" approach to parametric polynomial optimization (2010) SIAM J Optim, 20, pp. 1995-2022; Mitsos, A., Lemonidis, P., Cha Kun, L., Barton, P.I., Relaxation-based bounds for semi-infinite programs (2008) SIAM J Optim, 19, pp. 77-113; Parpas, P., Rustem, B., An algorithm for the global optimization of a class of continuous minimax problems (2009) J Optim Theory Appl, 141, pp. 461-473; Waki, H., Kim, S., Kojima, M., Maramatsu, M., Sums of squares and semidefinite programming relaxations for polynomial optimization problems with structured sparsity (2006) SIAM J Optim, 17, pp. 218-242",English,Article

The main focus of this work is on how to strengthen the linear programming relaxation of a given discretized formulation. More precisely, we will study and strengthen subproblems that arise in these formulations. In one case we will focus on the so-called knapsack reformulation which is based on viewing these models as the intersection of two polyhedra, one of them being a specialized knapsack problem. We will show that strong inequalities used in previous works are a special case of inequalities implied by the knapsack formulation. In the second case we will analyze a star-like subproblem and will provide an extended formulation for this problem as well as a set of inequalities on the original space, implied by the inequalities of the extended formulation. We will use a generalization of the Degree Constrained Spanning Tree problem as a setting for this study. In the present work, besides contextualizing these enhancements in terms of discretized models presented in previous works, we also compare and combine together them, for the first time. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Degree constraints; Knapsack; Spanning Tree; Valid inequalities,,"Albareda-Sambola, M., Fernández, E., Saldanha Da gama, F., The facility location problem with Bernoulli demands (2011) Omega, 39, pp. 335-345; Belotti, P., Brunetta, L., Malucelli, F., Multicommodity network design with discrete node costs (2007) Networks, 49, pp. 90-99; Constantino, M., Gouveia, L., Reformulation by discretization: application to Economic Lot Sizing (2007) Oper Res Lett, 35 (5), pp. 645-650; Correia, I., Gouveia, L., Saldanha Da gama, F., Solving the variable size bin packing problem with discretized formulations (2008) Comput Oper Res, 35 (6), pp. 2103-2113; Correia, I., Gouveia, L., Saldanha Da gama, F., Discretized formulations for capacitated location problems with modular distribution costs (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 204 (2), pp. 237-244; Croxton, K., Gendron, B., Magnanti, T., A comparison of mixed-integer programming models for non-convex piecewise linear cost minimization problems (2003) Manag Sci, 49, pp. 1268-1273; Cunha, A., Lucena, A., Lower and upper bounds for the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem (2007) Networks, 50 (1), pp. 55-66; Dahl, G., Foldnes, N., Gouveia, L., A note on hop-constrained walk polytopes (2004) Oper Res Lett, 32, pp. 345-349; Dahl, G., Gouveia, L., On the directed hop-constrained shortest path problem (2004) Oper Res Lett, 32, pp. 15-22; Duhamel, C., Gouveia, L., Moura, P., Souza, M., (2011) Minimum cost degree constrained spanning trees with node-degree costs.

One approach for incorporating such spatial information in a small area regression model is via Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). In GWR, the relationship between the outcome variable and the covariates is characterised by local rather than global parameters, where local is defined spatially. In this paper, we investigate GWR-based small area estimation under the M-quantile modelling approach. In particular, we specify an M-quantile GWR model that is a local model for the M-quantiles of the conditional distribution of the outcome variable given the covariates. This model is then used to define a bias-robust predictor of the small area characteristic of interest that also accounts for spatial association in the data. An important spin-off from applying the M-quantile GWR small area model is that it can potentially offer more efficient synthetic estimation for out of sample areas. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework through both model-based as well as design-based simulations, with the latter based on a realistic survey data set. The paper concludes with an illustrative application that focuses on estimation of average levels of Acid Neutralising Capacity for lakes in the Northeast of the USA. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Borrowing strength over space; Environmental data; Estimation for out of sample areas; Robust regression; Spatial dependency,,"Anselin, L., (1992) Spatial Econometrics.

Suppose that a population contains an infinite number of items, each item having probability p for nonconformity and probability 1-p for conformity. Items are inspected group by group, where each group contains m items, and the number of nonconforming items are recorded only when inspection of a group is completed. The inspection procedure is terminated if the cumulative number of nonconforming items recorded is greater than or equal to a specified number r. The distribution introduced in this paper consists of two random variables: the number of groups inspected, K, and the cumulative number of nonconforming items observed, X. Statistical properties and inferences for the bivariate distribution of (K,X) are studied. The authors also discuss the limiting case as m → ∞ and p → 0 with mp fixed, and derive a new bivariate distribution for group-by-group counting for Poisson processes that approaches the gamma distribution in limit. A new type of control chart and an acceptance sampling procedure are developed based on (K,X), and examples are given to illustrate their applications. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bernoulli process; Gamma distribution; Negative binomial group distribution; Poisson process; Poisson-Gamma group distribution; Sequential group sampling,,"Bailey, N.T.J., On estimating the size of mobile populations from recapture data (1951) Biometrika, 38, pp. 293-306; Best, D.J., The variance of the inverse binomial estimator (1974) Biometrika, 61, pp. 385-386; Bliss, C.I., Fitting the negative binomial distribution to biological data (1953) Biometrics, 9, pp. 176-196; Blum, J.R., Hanson, D.L., Rosenblatt, J.I., On the central limit theorem for the sum of a random number of independent random variables (1963) Z Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor, 1, pp. 389-393; Chan, L.Y., Xie, M., Goh, T.N., Two-stage control charts for high yield processes (1997) Int J Reliab Qual Saf Eng, 14, pp. 149-165; Chapman, D.G., Inverse, multiple and sequential sample censuses (1952) Biometrics, 8, pp. 286-306; Degroot, M.H., Unbiased sequential estimation for binomial populations (1959) Ann Math Stat, 30, pp. 80-101; Finney, D.J., On a method of estimating frequencies (1949) Biometrika, 36, pp. 233-234; Gerrard, D.J., Cook, R.D., Inverse binomial sampling as a basis for estimating negative binomial population densities (1972) Biometrics, 28, pp. 971-980; Girshick, M.A., Mosteller, F., Savage, L.J., Unbiased estimates for certain binomial sampling problems with applications (1946) Ann Math Stat, 17, pp. 13-23; Goh, T.N., A control chart for very high yield processes (1987) Qual Assur, 13, pp. 18-22; Gurland, J., Some interrelations among compound and generalized distributions (1957) Biometrika, 44, pp. 265-268; Haldane, J.B.S., On a method of estimating frequencies (1945) Biometrika, 33, pp. 222-225; Jackson, J.E., All count distributions are not alike (1972) J Qual Technol, 4, pp. 86-92; Johnson, N.L., Kemp, A.W., Kotz, S., (2005) Univariate Discrete Distributions, , 3rd edn., New York: Wiley-Interscience; Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., (1969) Discrete Distributions: Distributions in Statistics, , Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co; Matuszewski, T.I., Some properties of Pascal distribution for finite population (1962) J Am Stat Assoc, 57, pp. 172-174; Mikulski, P.W., Smith, P.J., A variance bound for unbiased estimation in inverse sampling (1976) Biometrika, 63, pp. 216-217; Nadler, J., Inverse binomial sampling plans when an exponential distribution is sampled with censoring (1960) Ann Math Stat, 31, pp. 1201-1204; Ord, J.K., The negative binomial model and quadrat sampling (1970) Random Counts in Scientific Work II: Random Counts in Biomedical and Social Sciences, pp. 151-163. , Patil (Ed.), University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press; Patil, G.P., Joshi, S.W., (1968) A Dictionary and Bibliography of Discrete Distributions, , New York: Publishing Co; Patil, G.P., Minimum variance unbiased estimation and certain problems of additive number theory (1963) Ann Math Stat, 34, pp. 1050-1056; Petrov, V.V., (1975) Sums of Independent Random Variables, , Berlin: Springer; Petrov, V.V., (1994) Limit Theorems of Probability Theory: Sequences of Independent Random Variables, , Oxford: Clarendon Press; Rényi, A., On the asymptotic distribution of the sum of a random number of independent random variables (1957) Acta Math Hungar, 8, pp. 193-199; Rényi, A., On the central limit theorem for the sum of a random number of independent random variables (1960) Acta Math Hungar, 11, pp. 97-102; Robbins, H., The asymptotic distribution of the sum of a random number of independent random variables (1948) Bull Am Math Soc, 54, pp. 1151-1161; Sandelius, M., An inverse sampling procedure for bacterial plate counts (1950) Biometrics, 6, pp. 291-292; Sathe, Y.S., Sharper variance bound for unbiased estimation in inverse sampling (1977) Biometrika, 64, pp. 425-426; Siegmund, D., (1985) Sequential Analysis: Tests and Confidence Intervals, , New York: Springer; Tweedie, M.C.K., Inverse statistical variates (1945) Nature, 156, p. 453; Wald, A., (1947) Sequential Analysis, , New York: Wiley; Weiler, H., Inverse sampling of a Poisson distribution (1972) Biometrics, 28, pp. 959-970; Xie, M., Goh, T.N., Kuralmani, V., (2002) Statistical Models and Control Charts for High-Quality Processes, , Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic",English,Article

This paper considers statistical inference for the semiparametric model when the covariates in the linear part are measured with additive error. To test hypothesis on the parametric component, we propose a novel test statistic based on the difference between the corrected residual sums of squares under the null and alternative hypotheses, and show that its limiting distribution is that of a weighted sum of independent standard χ 1 2. We also develop an adjusted test statistic, which has an asymptotically standard chi-squared distribution.

The good performance of the estimator is illustrated on some finite sample situations. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic normality; Consistency; Endpoint estimation; High-order moments,,"Aarssen, K., de Haan, L., On the maximal life span of humans (1994) Math Popul Stud, 4 (4), pp. 259-281; Athreya, K.B., Fukuchi, J., Confidence intervals for endpoints of a c.d.f. via bootstrap (1997) J Stat Plan Inference, 58, pp. 299-320; Billingsley, P., (1979) Probability and Measure, , New York: Wiley; Bingham, N.H., Goldie, C.M., Teugels, J.L., (1987) Regular Variation, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Chow, Y.S., Teicher, H., (1997) Probability Theory, , Berlin: Springer; Cooke, P., Statistical inference for bounds of random variables (1979) Biometrika, 66, pp. 367-374; de Haan, L., Estimation of the minimum of a function using order statistics (1981) J Am Stat Assoc, 76, pp. 467-469; de Haan, L., Ferreira, A., (2006) Extreme Value Theory, , Berlin: Springer; Dekkers, A.L.M., Einmahl, J.H.J., de Haan, L., A moment estimator for the index of an extreme-value distribution (1989) Ann Stat, 17, pp. 1833-1855; Drees, H., Ferreira, A., de Haan, L., On maximum likelihood estimation of the extreme value index (2003) Ann Appl Probab, 14, pp. 1179-1201; Goldenshluger, A., Tsybakov, A., Estimating the endpoint of a distribution in the presence of additive observation errors (2004) Stat Probab Lett, 68, pp. 39-49; Hall, P., On estimating the endpoint of a distribution (1982) Ann Stat, 10 (2), pp. 556-568; Hall, P., Wang, J.Z., Estimating the end-point of a probability distribution using minimum-distance methods (1999) Bernoulli, 5 (1), pp. 177-189; Hall, P., Wang, J.Z., Bayesian likelihood methods for estimating the end point of a distribution (2005) J R Stat Soc, Ser B, Stat Methodol, 67 (5), pp. 717-729; Hosking, J.R.M., Wallis, J.R., Parameter and quantile estimation for the generalized Pareto distribution (1987) Technometrics, 29, pp. 339-349; Li, D., Peng, L., Does bias reduction with external estimator of second order parameter work for endpoint?

However, existing methods either suffer from computational instability or require complex procedures involving trimming and smoothing, which complicates the asymptotic theory of the resulting estimators. In this paper, we propose a simple estimator that is obtained by applying standard quantile regression to observations in an informative subset. The proposed method is computationally convenient and conceptually transparent. We demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves the same asymptotical efficiency as the Powell's estimator, as long as the conditional censoring probability can be estimated consistently at a nonparametric rate and the estimated function satisfies some smoothness conditions. A simulation study suggests that the proposed estimator has stable and competitive performance relative to more elaborate competitors. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic efficiency; Censoring probability; Fixed censoring; Informative subset; Nonparametric; Quantile regression,,"Altman, N.S., An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression (1992) Am Stat, 46, pp. 175-185; Buchinsky, M., Changes in U.S. wage structure 1963-87: an application of quantile regression (1994) Econometrica, 62, pp. 405-458; Buchinsky, M., Hahn, J., An alternative estimator for the censored quantile regression model (1998) Econometrica, 66, pp. 653-671; Chen, X., Linton, O., van Keilegom, I., Estimation of semiparametric models when the criterion function is not smooth (2003) Econometrica, 71, pp. 1591-1608; Chernozhukov, V., Hong, H., Three-step censored regression quantile and extramarital affairs (2002) J Am Stat Assoc, 97, pp. 872-882; Fitzenberger, B., Computational aspects of censored quantile regression (1997) Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Statistical Data Analysis Based on the L 1-Norm and Related Methods, pp. 171-186. , Y.

The construction of general life tables is based on death statistics and census figures of resident populations under the hypothesis of closed demographic system. Among other assumptions, this hypothesis implicitly assumes that entries (immigrants) and exits (emigrants) of the population are usually not significant (being almost of the same magnitude for each age compensating each other). This paper theoretically extends the classical solution to open demographic systems and studies the impact of this hypothesis in constructing a life table. In particular, using the data of residential variations made available to the public by the Spanish National Statistical Office (INE, Instituto Nacional de Estadística) to approximate migratory flows, we introduce in the process of constructing a life table these flows and compare, before and after graduation, the crude mortality rates and the adjusted death probabilities obtained when migratory flows are, and are not, taken into account.",General population; Lexis diagram; Open demographic system,Classical solutions; General population; Lexis diagram; Life table; Mortality rate; National statistical offices; Open demographic system; Statistical methods; Statistics; Population statistics,"Ayuso, M., Corrales, H., Guillén, M., Pérez-Marín, A.M., Rojo, J.L., (2007) Estadística Actuarial Vida, , Barcelona: Publicacions Universitat de Barcelona; Benjamin, B., Pollard, J., (1992) The Analysis of Mortality and Other Actuarial Statistics, , London: Butterworth-Heinemann; Copas, J.B., Haberman, S., Non parametric graduation using kernel methods (1983) Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, 110, pp. 135-156; Forfar, D.O., MacCutcheon, J.J., Wilkie, A.D., On graduation by mathematical formula (1988) Journal of the Institute of Actuaries, 115, pp. 1-149; (2007) Metodología Empleada en el Cálculo de las Tablas de Mortalidad de la Población de Espana 1992-2005, , http://www.ine.es/daco/daco42/mortalidad/metodo9205.pdf, Madrid: INE.

In detail, we show that the introduction, in a functional data analysis, of a metric/semi-metric and of a group of warping functions, with respect to which the metric/semi-metric is invariant, enables a sound and not ambiguous definition of phase and amplitude variability. Indeed, in this framework, we prove that the analysis of a registered functional data set can be re-interpreted as the analysis of a set of suitable equivalence classes associated to original functions and induced by the group of the warping functions. Moreover, an amplitude-to-total variability index is proposed. This index turns out to be useful in practical situations for measuring to what extent phase variability affects the data and for comparing the effectiveness of different registration methods. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Alignment; Amplitude variability; Functional data analysis; Phase variability; Registration; Synchronization; Warping,,"Altman, N.S., Villarreal, J.C., Self-modelling regression for longitudinal data with time-invariant covariates (2004) Can J Stat, 32 (3), pp. 251-268; Brumback, L.C., Lindstrom, M.J., Self modeling with flexible, random time transformations (2004) Biometrics, 60 (2), pp. 461-470; Cuevas, A., Febrero, M., Fraiman, R., Robust estimation and classification for functional data via projection-based depth notions (2007) Comput Stat, 22 (3), pp. 481-496; Davidian, M., Lin, X., Wang, J.L., Introduction (Emerging issues in longitudinal and functional data analysis) (2004) Stat Sin, 14 (3), pp. 613-614; Delaigle, A., Hall, P., Defining probability density for a distribution of random functions (2010) Ann Stat, 38 (2), pp. 1171-1193; Ferraty, F., High-dimensional data: a fascinating statistical challenge (2010) J Multivar Anal, 101 (2), pp. 305-306; Ferraty, F., Romain, Y., (2011) The Oxford Handbook of Functional Data Analysis.

For any estimator P its quality is measured by the risk associated with normalized loss functions of linear-linear or inverse-linear form. These functions are possibly asymmetric, with arbitrary slope parameters a and b for P < P and P > P, respectively. Interest in these functions is motivated by their significance and potential uses, which are briefly discussed. Estimators are given for which the risk has an asymptotic value as p → 0, and which guarantee that, for any p ∈ (0,1), the risk is lower than its asymptotic value. This allows selecting the required number of successes, r, to meet a prescribed quality irrespective of the unknown p.

We approach the problem via its reparametrization in terms of Fourier coefficients in some corresponding system of functions and combining the resulting empirical Fourier coefficients. The empirical Fourier coefficients can be seen to be the asymptotically optimal linear rank statistics for the local sequences of nonparametric alternatives related to the introduced system of functions. Therefore, our first construction of the test is via multiple testing. The second test is based on sum of squares of censored empirical Fourier coefficients with the number of summands determined via a new model selection rule. The selection rule is fully automatic. Extensive simulations show that the new solutions improve upon existing tests based on adjusted variants of classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling and L 1-distance-based statistics, among others. We show that both tests control the error of the first kind for any fixed sample sizes and are capable of detecting essentially any alternative as the sample sizes are growing to infinity. We also discuss several aspects of our constructions, including possible efficiency calculations and asymptotic comparisons. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Data-driven test; Linear rank statistic; Model selection criteria; Multiple comparisons; Schwarz BIC; Stochastic dominance; Stochastic order,,"Anderson, G., Nonparametric tests of stochastic dominance in income distributions (1996) Econometrica, 64, pp. 1183-1193; Barrett, G.F., Donald, S.G., Consistent tests for stochastic dominance (2003) Econometrica, 71, pp. 71-104; Behnen, K., A characterization of certain rank-order tests with bounds for the asymptotic relative efficiency (1972) Ann Math Stat, 43, pp. 1839-1851; Behnen, K., Nichtparametrische Statistik: Zweistichproben Rangtests (1981) Z Angew Math Mech, 61, pp. T203-T212; Behnen, K., Neuhaus, G., (1989) Rank Tests with Estimated Scores and Their Application, , Stuttgart: Teubner; Bennett, C.J., (2008) Consistent integral-type tests for stochastic dominance, , Working Paper; Bickel, P.J., Ritov, Y., Testing for goodness of fit: a new approach (1992) Nonparametric Statistics and Related Topics, pp. 51-57. , AKMdESaleh (Ed.), Amsterdam: North-Holland; Borovkov, A.A., Sycheva, N.M., On asymptotically optimal non-parametric criteria (1968) Theory Probab Appl, 13, pp. 359-393; Buckley, M., Detecting a smooth signal: optimality of cusum based procedures (1991) Biometrika, 78, pp. 253-262; Christensen, R., Sun, S.K., Alternative goodness-of-fit tests for linear models (2010) J Am Stat Assoc, 105, pp. 291-301; Daubechies, I., Grossmann, A., Meyer, Y., Painless nonorthogonal expansions (1986) J Math Phys, 27, pp. 1271-1283; Davidson, R., Duclos, J.-Y., Statistical inference for stochastic dominance and for the measurement of poverty and inequality (2000) Econometrica, 68, pp. 1435-1464; Davidson, R., Duclos, J.-Y., (2009) Testing for restricted stochastic dominance, , Working Papers 39, GREQAM, Universities d'Aix-Marseille II and III; Doksum, K.A., Sievers, G.L., Plotting with confidence: graphical comparisons of two populations (1976) Biometrika, 63, pp. 421-434; Donoho, D., Jin, J., Higher criticism for detecting sparse heterogeneous mixtures (2004) Ann Stat, 32, pp. 962-994; Ducharme, G.R., Ledwina, T., Efficient and adaptive nonparametric test for the two-sample problem (2003) Ann Stat, 31, pp. 2036-2058; Eicker, F., The asymptotic distribution of the suprema of the standardized empirical process (1979) Ann Stat, 7, pp. 116-138; Escanciano, J.C., Lobato, I.N., An automatic Portmanteau test for serial correlation (2009) J Econom, 151, pp. 140-149; Escanciano, J.C., Mayoral, S., Data-driven smooth tests for the martingale difference hypothesis (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 1983-1998; Eubank, R.L., Hart, J.D., Testing goodness of fit in regression via order selection criteria (1992) Ann Stat, 20, pp. 1412-1425; Eubank, R.L., Testing for no effect by cosine series methods (2000) Scand J Stat, 27, pp. 747-763; Fan, J., Test of significance based on wavelet thresholding and Neyman's truncation (1996) J Am Stat Assoc, 91, pp. 674-688; Fan, J., Huang, L.-S., Goodness-of-fit tests for parametric regression models (2001) J Am Stat Assoc, 96, pp. 640-652; Franck, W.E., A likelihood ratio test for stochastic ordering (1984) J Am Stat Assoc, 79, pp. 686-691; Groeneboom, P., Shorack, G.R., Large deviations of goodness of fit statistics and linear combinations of order statistics (1981) Ann Probab, 9, pp. 971-987; Hájek, J., Šidák, Z., (1967) Theory of Rank Tests, , New York: Academic Press; Hall, P., Yatchew, A., Unified approach to testing functional hypotheses in semiparametric contexts (2005) J Econom, 127, pp. 225-252; Handcock, M.S., Morris, M., (1999) Relative Distribution Methods in the Social Sciences, , New York: Springer; Hyndman, R.J., Fan, Y., Sample quantiles in statistical packages (1996) Am Stat, 50, pp. 361-365; Inglot, T., Kallenberg, W.C.M., Ledwina, T., Asymptotic behaviour of some bilinear functionals of the empirical process (1993) Math Methods Stat, 2, pp. 316-336; Inglot, T., Ledwina, T., Moderately large deviations and expansions of large deviations for some functionals of weighted empirical process (1993) Ann Probab, 21, pp. 1691-1705; Inglot, T., Ledwina, T., Towards data driven selection of a penalty function for data driven Neyman tests (2006) Linear Algebra Appl, 417, pp. 124-133; Inglot, T., Ledwina, T., Data driven score tests for homoscedastic linear regression model: the construction and simulations (2006) Proceedings of Prague Stochastics, pp. 124-137. , M.

These conditions characterize a total interval order. For valued relations the Ferrers property can be written in two different and non-equivalent ways. In this work, we compare these properties by finding the kind of completeness they imply.

Additionally, the model allows us to provide an adequate solution for studying the mortality of a group pertaining to a larger population. It should therefore be possible to improve the mortality analysis for the regions in a country by taking into account the patterns within that country. Using official data from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, INE), we applied a modification of the Lee–Carter model to Spanish regions. The results of this model were then compared with other similar models such as the logit Brass, Li and Lee and Russolillo–Giordano–Haberman.

Such stationary distributions arise in performance evaluation for various queueing systems and their networks. However, it is very hard to obtain them analytically, so our interest is directed to analytically tractable characteristics. For this, we consider tail asymptotics of the stationary distributions. The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first overview the current approaches to attack the problem from a unified viewpoint. We then take up two approaches, Markov additive and analytic function approaches, which are recently developed by the author and his colleagues. We discuss their possible extensions. We mainly consider the tail asymptotics for two-dimensional reflecting processes, but also discuss how we can approach the case of more than two dimensions. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Convergence domain; Join the shortest queue; Large deviations; Light tail; Markov additive process; Multidimensional moment generating function; Queueing network; Reflecting random walk; Semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion; Server collaboration; Stability; Stationary distribution; Stationary inequality; Tail asymptotic; Tail decay rate,,"Adan, I., Foley, R.D., McDonald, D.R., Exact asymptotics for the stationary distribution of a Markov chain: a production model (2009) Queueing Syst, 62, pp. 311-344; Alsmeyer, G., On the Markov renewal theorem (1994) Stoch Process Appl, 50, pp. 37-56; Arjas, E., Speed, T.P., Symmetric Wiener-Hopf factorizations in Markov additive processes (1973) Z Wahrscheinlichkeitstheor Verw Geb, 26, pp. 105-118; Avram, F., Dai, J.G., Hasenbein, J.J., Explicit solutions for variational problems in the quadrant (2001) Queueing Syst, 37, pp. 259-289; Bertsimas, D., Paschalidis, I.C., Tsitsiklis, J.N., On the large deviations behavior of acyclic networks of G/G/1 queues (1998) Ann Appl Probab, 8, pp. 1027-1069; Borovkov, A.A., (1998) Ergodicity and Stability of Stochastic Processes, , Translated from Russian, New York: Wiley; Borovkov, A.A., Mogul'skii, A.A., The second rate function and the asymptotic problems of renewal and hitting the boundary for multidimensional random walks (1996) Sib Math J, 38, pp. 647-682; Borovkov, A.A., Mogul'skii, A.A., Integro-local limit theorems including large deviations for sums of random vectors.

Thus, not only the classification rules eliciting, but the application domain structuring as well, is a complex problem itself. The paper focuses on knowledge-based classification problem structuring in the context of complete (up to the expert knowledge) and consistent knowledge base construction for a Diagnostic Decision Support System. Two structuring techniques are proposed as expert aids, as well as an approach to large-size problem decomposition. It is asserted that application domain structuring and classification rules eliciting have to be arranged as interconnected procedures. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",68T35; 68U35; 91B06; Application domain structuring; Knowledge acquisition; Large-size problem decomposition; Multiattribute classification problems; Verbal decision analysis,,"Ashikhmin, I., Furems, E., Petrovsky, A., Sternin, M., Intelligent DSS under verbal decision analysis (2008) Encyclopedia of Decision Making and Decision Support Technologies, 1, pp. 514-527. , F.

Such behavior raises questions about procurement strategies that achieve system optimal (first-best) outcomes. In this paper, we examine the existence and uniqueness of pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) for a decentralized system that adopts a transfer payment approach proposed by Anupindi et al. (Manuf. Serv. Oper. Manag. 4(3):349-368, 2001). In particular, we state a set of conditions on cost parameters and distributions that guarantee uniqueness of PSNE and discuss its consequences. We also examine a situation with incomplete information and expand the scope of the earlier models by relaxing the assumption of satisfying local demand first. That is, we allow the retailers to transship their inventory regardless of the local demand status if such transshipment increases retailer's profit, and observe that this model extension does not affect our results relative to the more restrictive case. In short, our results provide important insights, clarifications, and strategic limitations regarding collaborations in decentralized distribution system. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cooperation and competition; Inventory games; Nash equilibrium,,"Anupindi, R., Bassok, Y., Zemel, E., A general framework for the study of decentralized distribution systems (2001) Manuf Serv Oper Manag, 4 (3), pp. 349-368; Aumann, R.J., Rationality and bounded rationality (1997) Games Econ Behav, 21, pp. 2-14; Aumann, R.J., Maschler, M.B., (1995) Repeated Games with Incomplete Information, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Bagnoli, M., Bergstrom, T., Log-concave probability and its applications (2005) Econ Theory, 26 (2), pp. 455-469; Fudenberg, D., Tirole, J., (1991) Game Theory, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Granot, D., Sošić, G., A three-stage model for a decentralized distribution system of retailers (2003) Oper Res, 51 (5), pp. 771-784; Hartman, B.C., Dror, M., Allocation of gains from inventory centralization in newsvendor environments (2005) IIE Trans, 37, pp. 93-107; Karaesmen, I., van Ryzin, G.J., Overbooking with substitutable inventory classes (2004) Oper Res, 52 (1), pp. 83-104; Kolmogorov, A.N., Fomin, S.V., (1970) Introductory Real Analysis, , (Translated by R.A.

The interactive analysis is navigated with the commonly accepted control parameters expressing reference levels for the individual objective functions. The partial achievement functions quantify the DM satisfaction from the individual outcomes with respect to the given reference levels, while the final scalarizing achievement function is built as the augmented max-min aggregation of the partial achievements. In order to avoid inconsistencies caused by the regularization, the max-min solution may be regularized by the Ordered Weighted Averages (OWA) with monotonic weights which combines all the partial achievements allocating the largest weight to the worst achievement, the second largest weight to the second worst achievement, and so on. Further, following the concept of the Weighted OWA (WOWA), the importance weighting of several achievements may be incorporated into the RPM. Such a WOWA RPM approach uses importance weights to affect achievement importance by rescaling accordingly its measure within the distribution of achievements rather than by straightforward rescaling of achievement values. The recent progress in optimization methods for ordered averages allows one to implement the WOWA RPM quite effectively as extension of the original constraints and criteria with simple linear inequalities. There is shown that the OWA and WOWA RPM models meet the crucial requirements with respect to the efficiency of generated solutions as well as the controllability of interactive analysis by the reference levels. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",90B50; 90C29; Efficiency; Interactive methods; Multicriteria decision making; OWA; Reference point method; WOWA,,"Geoffrion, A.M., Proper efficiency and the theory of vector maximization (1968) J Math Anal Appl, 22, pp. 618-630; Granat, J., Makowski, M., ISAAP-interactive specification and analysis of aspiration-based preferences (2000) Eur J Oper Res, 122, pp. 469-485; Kaliszewski, I., (1994) Quantitative Pareto Analysis by Cone Separation Technique, , Dordrecht: Kluwer; Kostreva, M.M., Ogryczak, W., Wierzbicki, A., Equitable aggregations and multiple criteria analysis (2004) Eur J Oper Res, 158, pp. 362-367; Lewandowski, A., Wierzbicki, A.P., (1989) Aspiration Based Decision Support Systems-Theory, Software and Applications, , Berlin: Springer; Liu, X., Some properties of the weighted OWA operator (2006) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern B, 368, pp. 118-127; Llamazares, B., Simple and absolute special majorities generated by OWA operators (2004) Eur J Oper Res, 158, pp. 707-720; Makowski, M., Granat, J., Schenler, W., Hirschberg, S., Requirement analysis for the multicriteria analysis in the NEEDS project (2009) Interim Report IR-09-13, , IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; Miettinen, K., (1999) Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization, , Dordrecht: Kluwer; Miettinen, K., Mäkelä, M.M., On scalarizing functions in multiobjective optimization (2002) OR Spectrum, 24, pp. 193-213; Miettinen, K., Deb, K., Jahn, J., Ogryczak, W., Shimoyama, K., Vetschera, R., Future challenges (2008) Multiobjective optimization: Interactive and evolutionary approaches, 5252, pp. 435-461. , In: Branke J, Deb K, Miettinen K, Słowiński R (eds) LNCS; Ogryczak, W., A goal programming model of the reference point method (1994) Ann Oper Res, 51, pp. 33-44; Ogryczak, W., Preemptive reference point method (1997) Multicriteria Analysis-Proceedings of the XIth International Conference on MCDM, pp. 156-167. , J.

Different intervention strategies, including nutrient abatement and the construction of facilities to increase the water exchange between the lagoon and the outside sea, have been proposed to achieve good water quality in terms of trophic state and conditions for waterfowl. The selection of an intervention strategy is a complex decision-making problem in which several conflicting objectives, like costs of application and environmental or social impacts, must be taken into account simultaneously. We propose a PC-based decision support system, called the Generic Multi-Attribute Analysis system, to deal with such interdisciplinary analyses. It evaluates the intervention strategies by means of an additive multiattribute utility model accounting for imprecision of the various components of the analysis, such as intervention strategy performances and decision-makers' preferences. Also, it implements what is known as decision making with partial information, through the application of Monte Carlo simulation techniques. This enables a straightforward analysis of the difference between an anthropocentrist and an ecocentrist view of the problem, from which a final recommendation can be reached. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Decision analysis; Decision support systems; Multiattribute utility model; Nutrient abatement; Water exchange; Waterfowl,,"Bratley, P., Fox, B.L., Schrage, E.L., (1983) A Guide to Simulation, , New York: Springer; Brownlow, S.A., Watson, S.R., Structuring multi-attribute value hierarchies (1987) J Oper Res Soc, 38, pp. 309-317; Bryhn, A.C., Håkanson, L., Eklund, J.M., (2007) Variabilities and uncertainties in key coastal water variables as a basis for understanding changes and obtaining predictive power in modelling, , Manuscript, Uppsala University; Bryhn, A.C., Jiménez, A., Mateos, A., Multi-attribute analysis of water quality and waterfowl management in Ringkøbing Fjord, Denmark (2009) J Environ Man, 90 (8), pp. 2568-2577; Clemen, R.T., (1996) Making Hard Decisions: An Introduction to Decision Analysis, , Beltmon: Duxbury; Duarte, C.M., Seagrass depth limits (1991) Aquatic Bot, 40, pp. 363-377; Gatto, M., Muratori, S., Rinaldi, S., On the optimality of the logistic growth (1988) J Optim Theor Appl, 57, pp. 513-517; Gren, I-M., Turner, K., Wulff, F., (2000) Managing a Sea, , London: Earthscan; Hanson, M.A., Butler, M.G., Responses to food web manipulation in a shallow waterfowl lake (1994) Hydrobiol, 279-280, pp. 457-466; Hargeby, A., Andersson, G., Blindow, I., Trophic web structure in a shallow eutrophic lake during a dominance shift from phytoplankton to submerged macrophytes (1994) Hydrobiol, 279-280, pp. 83-90; Håkanson, L., Bryhn, A.C., Goals and remedial strategies for water quality and wildlife management in a coastal lagoon-a case-study of Ringk øbing fjord, Denmark (2008) J Environ Manag, 86, pp. 498-519; Håkanson, L., Bryhn, A.C., Eklund, J.M., Modelling phosphorus and suspended particulate matter in Ringkøbing fjord in order to understand regime shifts (2007) J Mar Syst, 68, pp. 65-90; Ito, K., Xu, Z.X., Jinno, K., Decision support system for surface water planning in river basins (2001) J Water Resour Plan Manag, 127, pp. 272-276; Jiménez, A., Mateos, A., Ríos-Insua, S., Contracting of cleaning services in a European underground transportation company with the aid of a DSS (2007) Decis Sup Syst, 43 (4), pp. 1485-1498; Jiménez, A., Ríos-Insua, S., Mateos, S., A decision support system for multiattribute utility evaluation based on imprecise assignments (2003) Decis Sup Syst, 36 (1), pp. 65-79; Jiménez, A., Ríos-Insua, S., Mateos, S., Monte-Carlo simulation techniques in a multi-attribute decision support system (2003) Proc 12th IASTED Int Conf on Applied Simulation and Modelling, pp. 85-90. , Calgary: ACTA Press; Jiménez, A., Ríos-Insua, S., Mateos, A., A generic multi-attribute analysis system (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 1081-1101; Jiménez, A., Rodríguez, L.C., Ríos-Insua, S., Selection of segments to be sourced from low cost countries for a global industrial equipment manufacturer based on a multi-attribute decision support system (2005) Res Comput Sci, 17, pp. 3-12; Keeney, R.L., Raiffa, H., (1976) Decision with Multiple Objectives: Preferences and Value-Tradeoffs, , New York: Wiley; Kirkwood, C.W., (1997) Strategic Decision Making: Multiobjective Decision Analysis with Spreadsheets, , Beltmon: Duxbury; Lee, K.S., Park, K.S., Kim, S.H., Dominance, potential optimality, imprecise information and hierarchical structure in multi-criteria analysis (2002) Comput Oper Res, 29, pp. 1267-1281; Mateos, A., Ríos-Insua, S., Jiménez, A., Dominance potential optimality and alternative ranking in an imprecise multi-attribute model (2007) J Oper Res Soc, 58 (3), pp. 326-336; Petersen, J.K., Hansen, J.W., Brogaard, L.M., (2007) Regime shift in a coastal marine ecosystem, , Manuscript, Danish National Environmental Research Institute; Poch, M., Comas, J., Rodríguez-Roda, I., Designing and building real environmental decision support systems (2004) Environ Model Softw, 19, pp. 857-873; Raiffa, H., (1982) The Art and Science of Negotiation, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Rauschmayer, F., Reflections on ethics and MCA in environmental decisions (2001) J Multi-Criteria Dec Anal, 10, pp. 65-74; (2001) Sluice capacity-The Hvide Sande sluice, , Ringkjøbing County Ringkjøbing County, Ringkøbing (in Danish); Ríos, S., Ríos-Insua, S., Ríos, I.D., Experiments in robust decision making (1994) Decision Theory and Decision Analysis: Trends and Challenges, pp. 233-242. , S.

In this context we employ three stability notions: individual, contractual, and compensational stability. These notions differ in terms of the underlying contractual assumptions. We characterize the coalitional games in which individually stable outcomes exist by means of the top-partition property. Furthermore, we show that any coalition structure of maximum social worth is both contractually and compensationally stable. Applying the general framework to an example of mutual insurance in production, we find that in each type of contractual setting there are stable individually rational pooling outcomes, while, on the contrary, individually rational separating outcomes are not stable in general. In addition, we study monotonic simple proper games and establish that any outcome containing a winning coalition is both contractually and compensationally stable.

We test the null hypothesis of a parametric class against a composite nonparametric alternative. Each density under the alternative is separated in the L2-norm from any density lying in the null hypothesis. The copula densities under consideration are assumed to belong to a range of Besov balls. According to the minimax approach, the testing problem is solved in an adaptive framework: it leads to a log log loss term in the minimax rate of testing in comparison with the non-adaptive case. A smoothness-free test statistic that achieves the minimax rate is proposed.

Immigrants are assumed to be unobservable, and it is only possible to sample the number of females, males, and couples (mating units) in each generation. Under these conditions, weighted conditional least square estimators are proposed for the offspring and immigration mean vectors. Asymptotic properties of such estimators are investigated when the process is subcritical and supercritical, paying especial attention to their strong consistency and limit distributions.

The basic properties of the resulting sinh-arcsinhed t family of distributions are presented, many of them effectively having the same level of complexity as their Student t counterparts. Quantile-based measures, which come to the fore due to the non-existence of moments, are readily available. The parameters of the distribution have clear interpretations. Limiting distributions as shape parameters tend to their extreme values are especially appealing. The family's simplest sub-class is closely related to a sub-class of the LU family. Likelihood based inference is considered and applied in the analysis of heavy-tailed and skew data on fibre glass strengths. Comparisons are made throughout with two of the most popular existing competitors to this distribution: it scores very well relative to them on a number of tractability grounds. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Azzalini-type distributions; Heavy tails; Quantile-based measures; Skewness; Student's t distribution; Two-piece distributions,,"Aas, K., Haff, I.H., The generalized hyperbolic skew student's t-distribution (2006) J Financ Econ, 4, pp. 275-309; (1965) Handbook of Mathematical Functions, , M.

Rao in Small Area Estimation, Wiley, New York, 2003). These model-based estimates can differ widely from the direct estimates, especially for areas with very low sample sizes. While model-based small area estimates are very useful, one potential difficulty with such estimates is that when aggregated, the overall estimate for a larger geographical area may be quite different from the corresponding direct estimate, the latter being usually believed to be quite reliable. This is because the original survey was designed to achieve specified inferential accuracy at this higher level of aggregation. The problem can be more severe in the event of model failure as often there is no real check for validity of the assumed model. Moreover, an overall agreement with the direct estimates at an aggregate level may sometimes be politically necessary to convince the legislators of the utility of small area estimates. One way to avoid this problem is the so-called ""benchmarking approach"", which amounts to modifying these model-based estimates so that we get the same aggregate estimate for the larger geographical area. Currently, the most popular approach is the so-called ""raking"" or ratio adjustment method, which involves multiplying all the small area estimates by a constant data-dependent factor so that the weighted total agrees with the direct estimate. There are alternate proposals, mostly from frequentist considerations, which meet also the aforementioned benchmarking criterion. We propose in this paper a general class of constrained Bayes estimators which also achieve the necessary benchmarking. Many of the frequentist estimators, including some of the raked estimators, follow as special cases of our general result. Explicit Bayes estimators are derived which benchmark the weighted mean or both the weighted mean and weighted variability. We illustrate our methodology by developing poverty rates in school-aged children at the state level and then benchmarking these estimates to match at the national level. Unlike the existing frequentist benchmarking literature, which is primarily based on linear models, the proposed Bayesian approach can accommodate any arbitrary model, and the benchmarked Bayes estimators are based only on the posterior mean and the posterior variance-covariance matrix. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Area-level; Penalty parameter; Two-stage; Weighted mean; Weighted variability,,"Bell, W.R., Accounting for uncertainty about variances in small area estimation (1999) Bulletin of the International Statistical Institute, , 52nd Session, Helsinki; Berger, J.O., (1985) Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, , 2nd edn., New York: Springer; Datta, G.S., Lahiri, P., A unified measure of uncertainty of estimated best linear unbiased predictors in small area estimation problems (2000) Stat Sin, 10, pp. 613-627; Datta, G.S., Rao, J.N.K., Smith, D.D., On measuring the variability of small area estimators under a basic area level model (2005) Biometrika, 92, pp. 183-196; Fay, R.E., Herriot, R.A., Estimates of income from small places: an application of James-Stein procedures to census data (1979) J Am Stat Assoc, 74, pp. 269-277; Flegal, M., Jones, G., Batch means and spectral variance estimators in Markov chain Monte Carlo (2010) Ann Stat, 38, pp. 1034-1070; Ghosh, M., Constrained Bayes estimation with applications (1992) J Am Stat Assoc, 87, pp. 533-540; Isaki, C.T., Tsay, J.H., Fuller, W.A., Estimation of census adjustment factors (2000) Surv Methodol, 26, pp. 31-42; Louis, T.A., Estimating a population of parameter values using Bayes and empirical Bayes methods (1984) J Am Stat Assoc, 79, pp. 393-398; Pfeffermann, D., Barnard, C.H., Some new estimators for small area means with application to the assessment of farmland values (1991) J Bus Econ Stat, 9, pp. 73-84; Pfeffermann, D., Nathan, G., Regression analysis of data from a cluster sample (1981) J Am Stat Assoc, 76, pp. 681-689; Pfeffermann, D., Tiller, R., Small-area estimation with state-space models subject to benchmark constraints (2006) J Am Stat Assoc, 101, pp. 1387-1397; Prasad, N.G.N., Rao, J.N.K., The estimation of the mean squared error of small-area estimators (1990) J Am Stat Assoc, 85, pp. 163-171; Toto, M., Nandram, B., A Bayesian predictive inference for small area means incorporating covariates and sampling weights (2010) J Stat Plan Inference, 140, pp. 2963-2979; Rao, J.N.K., (2003) Small Area Estimation, , New York: Wiley; Wang, J., Fuller, W.A., Qu, Y., Small area estimation under a restriction (2008) Surv Methodol, 34, pp. 29-36; You, Y., Rao, J.N.K., A pseudo-empirical best linear unbiased prediction approach to small area estimation using survey weights (2002) Can J Stat, 30, pp. 431-439; You, Y., Rao, J.N.K., Pseudo hierarchical Bayes small area estimation combining unit level models and survey weights (2003) J Stat Plan Inference, 111, pp. 197-208; You, Y., Rao, J.N.K., Dick, P., Benchmarking hierarchical Bayes small area estimators in the Canadian census undercoverage estimation (2004) Stat Transit, 6, pp. 631-640; Zellner, A., Further results on Bayesian minimum expected loss (MELO) estimates and posterior distributions for structural coefficients (1986) Advances in Econometrics, pp. 171-182. , D.

This problem is equivalent to estimating quantiles when covariate information is available and when their order converges to one as the sample size increases. We show that, under some conditions, these so-called ""extreme conditional quantiles"" can still be estimated through a kernel estimator of the conditional survival function. Sufficient conditions on the rate of convergence of their order to one are provided to obtain asymptotically Gaussian distributed estimators. Making use of this result, some kernel estimators of the conditional tail-index are introduced and a Weissman type estimator is derived, permitting to estimate extreme conditional quantiles of arbitrary large order.

The approach stems from a recent representation of these copulas as the survival copulas of simplex distributions. The procedures are based on a reconstruction of the radial part of the simplex distribution from the Kendall distribution, which arises through the multivariate probability integral transformation of the data. In the bivariate case, the methodology is justified by the well known fact that an Archimedean copula is in one-to-one correspondence with its Kendall distribution. It is proved here that this property continues to hold in the trivariate case, and strong evidence is provided that it extends to any dimension. In addition, a criterion is derived for the convergence of sequences of multivariate Archimedean copulas. This result is then used to show consistency of the proposed estimators. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Archimedean copula; Consistency; Frailty; Kendall distribution; Probability integral transform;

It rests on the characterization of the normal distribution given by Borovkov and Utev, i. e., a r. v. is normal if and only if its Poincaré constant is equal to its variance. The test statistic is computed by estimating the Poincaré constant via orthonormal polynomials. In case of known expectation and variance, the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis, and the consistency of the test is proved. An analysis of effects of the degree of polynomials on the procedure is sketched. A Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the distribution when population expectation and variance are replaced by their empirical counterparts. In this framework, we study the level and power of the test for finite samples by means of a simulation experiment including a comparison with other tests. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic normality; Borovkov-Utev characterization; Normality test; Orthogonal polynomials; Poincaré inequality,,"Anderson, T.W., Darling, D.A., Asymptotic theory of certain ""goodness-of-fit"" criteria based on stochastic processes (1952) Ann Stat, 23, pp. 193-212; Azzalini, A., A class of distribution which includes the normal ones (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Bontemps, C., Meddahi, N., Testing normality: a GMM approach (2005) J Econom, 124, pp. 149-186; Borovkov, A.A., Utev, S.A., On an inequality and a related characterization of the normal distribution (1984) Theory Probab Appl, 28, pp. 219-228; Cacoullos, T., Papathanasiou, V., Characterization of distributions by generalizations of variance bounds and simple proofs of the CLT (1997) J Stat Plan Inference, 63, pp. 157-171; Chen, L.H., Lou, J.H., Characterization of probability distributions by Poincaré-type inequalities (1987) Ann Inst Henri Poincaré, 23, pp. 91-110; Chernoff, H., A note on an inequality involving the normal distribution (1981) Ann Probab, 9, pp. 533-535; Agostino, R.B.D., Stephens, M.A., (1986) Goodness-of-Fit Techniques, 68. , Statistics: Textbooks and monographs series (Eds.), New York: Dekker; D'Agostino, R.B., Belanger, A., D'Agostino Jr., R.B., A suggestion for using powerful and informative tests of normality (1990) Am Stat, 44, pp. 316-321; Declercq, D., Duvaut, P., (1997) Hermite normality test, , In: ICASSP-97, Munich; Eaton, M.L., Tyler, D.E., On Wielandt's inequality and its application on the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of a random symmetric matrix (1991) Ann Stat, 19, pp. 260-271; Gautschi, W., (2004) Orthogonal Polynomials, Computation and Approximation, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Goia, A., Salinelli, E., (2010) Optimal nonlinear transformations of random variables, , Ann Inst Henri Poincaré Probab Stat, forthcoming; Jarque, C.M., Bera, A.K., Efficient tests for normality, homoschedasticity and serial independence of regression residuals (1980) Econ Lett, 6, pp. 255-259; Johnson, O., Barron, A., Fisher information inequalities and the central limit theorem (2004) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 129, pp. 391-409; Klaassen, C.A.J., On an inequality of Chernoff (1985) Ann Probab, 13, pp. 966-974; Lilliefors, H.W., On the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality with mean and variance (1967) J Am Stat Assoc, 62, pp. 399-402; Pierce, J.G., Varga, R.S., Higher order convergence results for the Rayleigh-Ritz method applied to eigenvalue problems, I: estimates relating Rayleigh-Ritz and Galerkin approximations to eigenfunctions (1972) SIAM J Numer Anal, 9, pp. 137-151; Prakasa Rao, B.L.S., Sreehari, M., Another characterization of multivariate normal distribution (1986) Stat Probab Lett, 4, pp. 209-210; Purkayastha, S., Bhandari, S.K., Characterization of uniform distribution by inequalities of Chernoff type (1990) Sankhya Ser A, 52, pp. 376-382; Salinelli, E., Nonlinear principal components I.

The aim of this paper is to determine bounds of the optimal values. We propose a general framework for solving such problems. Under some assumption, the exact lower and upper bounds are computable by using two non-interval optimization problems. While these two optimization problems are hard to solve in general, we show that for some particular subclasses they can be reduced to easy problems. Subclasses that are considered are convex quadratic programming and posynomial geometric programming. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Dependence; Interval matrix; Interval systems; Nonlinear programming; Optimal value range,,"Alefeld, G., Herzberger, J., (1983) Introduction to Interval Computations, , London: Academic Press; Bazaraa, M.S., Sherali, H.D., Shetty, C.M., Nonlinear Programming (1993) Theory and Algorithms, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Boţ, R.I., Grad, S.M., Wanka, G., Fenchel-Lagrange duality versus geometric duality in convex optimization (2006) J Optim Theory Appl, 129 (1), pp. 33-54; Chinneck, J.W., Ramadan, K., Linear programming with interval coefficients (2000) J Oper Res Soc, 51 (2), pp. 209-220; Dorn, W.S., Duality in quadratic programming (1960) Q Appl Math, 18 (2), pp. 155-162; Duffin, R.J., Peterson, E.L., Duality theory for geometric programming (1966) SIAM J Appl Math, 14 (6), pp. 1307-1349; Fiedler, M., Nedoma, J., Ramik, J., Rohn, J., Zimmermann, K., (2006) Linear Optimization Problems with Inexact Data, , New York: Springer; Gerlach, W., Zur Lösung linearer Ungleichungssysteme bei Störung der rechten Seite und der Koeffizientenmatrix (1981) Math Oper Stat Ser Optim, 12, pp. 41-43; Hansen, E., Walster, G.W., (2004) Global Optimization Using Interval Analysis, , 2nd edn., New York: Dekker; Hladík, M., Optimal value range in interval linear programming (2007) Fuzzy Optim Decis Mak (Submitted), , Available as a technical report KAM-DIMATIA Series 2007-824, Dep of Appl Math, Prague; Hu, B., Wang, S., A novel approach in uncertain programming part I: new arithmetic and order relation for interval numbers (2006) J Ind Manage Optim, 2 (4), pp. 351-371; Hu, B., Wang, S., A novel approach in uncertain programming.

The objective of this study is to find the optimal pricing and ordering strategies for an integrated inventory system when a quantity discount policy is applied. The pricing strategy discussed here is one in which the vendor offers a quantity discount to the buyer. Then, the buyer will adjust his retail price based on the purchasing cost, which will influence the customer demand as a result. Consequently, an integrated inventory model is established to find the optimal solutions for order quantity, retail price, and the number of shipments from vendor to buyer in one production run, so that the joint total profit incurred has the maximum value. Also, numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the results of the model. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Integrated model; Markup rate; Price-sensitive demand; Quantity discount,,"Allenby, G.M., Shively, T.S., Yang, S., Garratt, M.J., A choice model for packaged goods: dealing with discrete quantities and quantity discounts (2004) Mark Sci, 23 (1), pp. 95-108; Burke, G.J., Carrillo, J., Vakharia, A.J., Heuristics for sourcing from multiple suppliers with alternative quantity discounts (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 186, pp. 317-329; Chang, H.C., Ouyang, L.Y., Wu, K.S., Ho, C.H., Integrated vendor-buyer cooperative inventory models with controllable lead time and ordering cost reduction (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 170, pp. 481-495; Chung, C.S., Hum, S.H., Kirca, O., The coordinated replenishment dynamic lot-sizing problems with quantity discounts (1996) Eur J Oper Res, 94, pp. 122-133; Corbett, C.J., de Groote, X., A supplier's optimal quantity discount policy under asymmetric information (2000) Manag Sci, 46, pp. 444-450; Dolan, R.J., Quantity discounts: managerial issues and research opportunities (1987) Mark Sci, 6, pp. 1-22; Goyal, S.K., An integrated inventory model for a single supplier-single customer problem (1976) Int J Prod Res, 15 (1), pp. 107-111; Goyal, S.K., ""A joint economic-lot-size model for purchaser and vendor"": a comment (1988) Decis Sci, 19, pp. 236-241; Hadley, G., Whitin, T., (1963) Analysis of Inventory Systems, , New Jersey: Prentice Hall; Hariga, M., Ben-Daya, M., Some stochastic inventory models with deterministic variable lead time (1999) Eur J Oper Res, 113, pp. 42-51; Hofmann, C., Supplier's pricing policy in a just-in-time environment (2000) Comput Oper Res, 27, pp. 1357-1373; Joglekar, P., Comments on ""A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits"" (1988) Manag Sci, 34, pp. 1391-1398; Lee, H.L., Rosenblatt, M.J., A generalized quantity discount pricing model to increase supplier's profits (1986) Manag Sci, 32 (9), pp. 1177-1185; Li, S.X., Huang, Z., Managing buyer-seller system cooperation with quantity discount considerations (1995) Comput Oper Res, 22 (9), pp. 947-958; Li, J., Liu, L., Supply chain coordination with quantity discount policy (2006) Int J Prod Econ, 101, pp. 89-98; Lin, Y.J., Minimax distribution free procedure with backorder price discount (2008) Int J Prod Econ, 111, pp. 118-128; Monahan, J.P., A quantity discount pricing model to increase vendor profits (1984) Manag Sci, 30 (6), pp. 720-726; Moon, I., Choi, S., A note on lead time and distributional assumptions in continuous review inventory models (1998) Comput Oper Res, 25, pp. 1007-1012; Munson, C.L., Rosenblatt, M.J., Theories and realities of quantity discounts: an exploratory study (1998) Prod Oper Manag, 7 (4), pp. 352-369; Munson, C.L., Rosenblatt, M.J., Coordinating a three-level supply chain with quantity discount (2001) IIE Trans, 33, pp. 371-384; Ouyang, L.Y., Chuang, B.R., Lin, Y.J., Effective investment to reduce lost sales in a periodic review inventory model (2007) OR Spectr, 29, pp. 681-697; Pan, J.C.H., Yang, J.S., A study of an integrated inventory with controllable lead time (2002) Int J Prod Res, 40 (5), pp. 1263-1273; Parlar, M., Wang, Q., Discounting decisions in a supplier-buyer relationship with a linear buyer's demand (1994) IIE Trans, 26, pp. 34-41; Qin, Y., Tang, H., Guo, C., Channel coordination and volume discounts with price-sensitive demand (2007) Int J Prod Econ, 105, pp. 43-53; Sheen, G.J., Tsao, Y.C., Channel coordination, trade credit and quantity discounts for freight cost (2007) Transp Res Part E, 43, pp. 112-128; Tsai, J.F., An optimization approach for supply chain management models with quantity discount policy (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 177, pp. 982-994; Viswanathan, S., Wang, Q., Discount pricing decisions in distribution channels with price-sensitive demand (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 149, pp. 571-587; Weng, Z.K., Modeling quantity discounts under general price-sensitive demand functions: optimal policies and relationships (1995) Eur J Oper Res, 86, pp. 300-314; Weng, Z.K., Wong, R.T., General models for the supplier's all-unit quantity discount policy (1993) Nav Res Logist, 40, pp. 971-991; Yang, P.C., Pricing strategy for deteriorating items using quantity discount when demand is price sensitive (2004) Eur J Oper Res, 157, pp. 389-397",English,Article

Genes of interest are selected on the basis of an obtained p-value, and, thus, the list of candidates may vary depending on the data processing steps taken and statistical tests applied. Using standard approaches to the statistical analysis of microarray data from individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), several genes have been proposed as candidates. However, the lists of genes detected as differentially regulated in published mRNA expression analyses of Autism often do not overlap, owed at least in part to (i) the multifactorial nature of ASD, (ii) the high inter-individual variability of the gene expression in ASD cases, and (iii) differences in the statistical analysis approaches applied. Game theory recently has been proposed as a new method to detect the relevance of gene expression in different conditions. In this work, we test the ability of Game theory, specifically the Shapley value, to detect candidate ASD genes using a microarray experiment in which only a few genes can be detected as dysregulated using conventional statistical approaches. Our results showed that coalitional games significantly increased the power to identify candidates. A further functional analysis demonstrated that groups of these genes were associated with biological functions and disorders previously shown to be related to ASD. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cooperative games; Gene expression; Microarrays,,"Abrahams, B.S., Geschwind, D.H., Advances in autism genetics: on the threshold of a new neurobiology (2008) Nat Rev Genet, 9, pp. 341-355; Draghici, S., (2003) Data Analysis Tools for DNA Microarrays, , UK: Chapman& Hall/CRC Press; Gregg, J.P., Lit, L., Baron, C.A., Hertz-Picciotto, I., Walker, W., Davis, R.A., Croen, L.A., Sharp, F.R., Gene expression changes in children with autism (2008) Genomics, 91, pp. 22-29; Lee, N.H., Saeed, A.I., Microarrays: an overview (2007) Methods Mol Biol, 353, pp. 265-300; Moretti, S., Patrone, F., Bonassi, S., The class of Microarray games and the relevance index for genes (2007) Top, 15, pp. 265-280; Moretti, S., van Leeuwen, D., Gmuender, H., Bonassi, S., van Delft, J., Kleinjans, J., Patrone, F., Merlo, D.F., Combining Shapley value and statistics to the analysis of gene expression data in children exposed to air pollution (2008) BMC Bioinf, 9, p. 361; Shi, L., Perkins, R.G., Fang, H., Tong, W., Reproducible and reliable microarray results through quality control: good laboratory proficiency and appropriate data analysis practices are essential (2008) Curr Opin Biotechnol, 19, pp. 10-18; Wall, D.P., Esteban, F.J., Deluca, T.F., Huyck, M., Monaghan, T., Velez de mendizabal, N., Goñí, J., Kohane, I.S., Comparative analysis of neurological disorders focuses genome-wide search for autism genes (2009) Genomics, 93, pp. 120-129",English,Article

Change 81:71-95, 2007). Some of these extremes, like drought or frost episodes, largely affect agricultural outputs, and risk management becomes crucial. The goal of this paper it is to analyze farmers' decisions about risk management, taking into account climatological and meteorological information. We consider a situation in which the farmer, as part of crop management, has available technology to protect the harvest from weather effects. This approach has been used by Murphy et al. (Mon. Weather Rev. 113:801-813, 1985), Katz and Murphy (J.

In our model, we introduce the attitude towards risk. Thus we can evaluate how the optimal decision is affected by the absolute risk aversion coefficient of Arrow and Pratt, and compute the economic value of the information in this context, while proposing a measure to estimate the amount of money that the farmer is willing to pay for this information in terms of the certainty equivalent. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cost-loss ratio; Decision models; Information value; Risk aversion,,"Baquet, A.E., Halter, A.N., Conklin, F.S., The value of frost forecasting: a Bayesian appraisal (1976) Am J Agric Econ, 58, pp. 511-520; Beniston, M., Stephenson, D.B., Christensen, O.B., Ferro, C., Frei, C., Goyette, S., Halsnaes, K., Woth, K., Future extreme events in European climate: an exploration of regional climate model projections (2007) Clim Change, 81, pp. 71-95; Clemen, R.T., (1996) Making Hard Decisions: An Introduction to Decision Analysis, , 2nd edn., Belmont: Duxbury; Gómez-Limón, J.A., Arriaza, M., Riesgo, L., An MCDM analysis of agricultural risk aversion (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 569-585; Climate Change 2007 (2007) Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, , IPCC, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Katz, R.W., Murphy, A.H., Quality/value relationship for imperfect weather forecasts in a prototype multistage decision-making model (1990) J Forecast, 9, pp. 75-86; Katz, R.W., Murphy, A.H., Forecast value: prototype decision-making models (1997) Economic Value of Weather and Climate Forecasts, pp. 183-217. , R.

It is based on the idea of the modified nucleolus (the modiclus) and takes into account both the constructive power and the blocking power of a coalition. The SM-nucleolus inherits this convenient property from the modified nucleolus, but it avoids its high computational complexity. We prove that the SM-nucleolus of an arbitrary n-person TU-game coincides with the prenucleolus of a certain n-person constant-sum game, which is constructed as the average of the game and its dual. Some properties of the new solution are discussed. We show that the SM-nucleolus coincides with the Shapley value for three-person games. However, this does not hold for general n-person cooperative TU-games. To confirm this fact, a counter example is presented in the paper. On top of this, we give several examples that illustrate similarities and differences between the SM-nucleolus and well-known solution concepts for TU-games. Finally, the SM-nucleolus is applied to the weighted voting games. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Cooperative TU-game; Modiclus; SM-nucleolus; Solution concept; Weighted voting games,,"Banzhaf, J., Weighted voting doesn't work: a mathematical analysis (1965) Rutgers Law Rev, 19, pp. 317-343; Kopelowitz, A., Computation of the kernel of simple games and the nucleolus of n-person games (1967) Program in Game Th and Math Economics, , Dept of Math, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem RM 31; Maschler, M., Peleg, B., Shapley, L.S., Geometric properties of the kernel, nucleolus and related solution concepts (1979) Math Oper Res, 4, pp. 303-338; Maschler, M., The bargaining set, kernel, and nucleolus: a survey (1992) Handbook of Game Theory, 1, pp. 591-665. , R.

(Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 54:348-366, 2010), which is very useful in situations in which the response is restricted to the standard unit interval (0,1). Our results generalize those in Espinheira et al. (Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 52:4417-4431, 2008a; J. Appl. Stat. 35:407-419, 2008b), which only apply to linear beta regression models. We define some residuals, and a Portmanteau test for serial correlation. Further, some influence methods, such as the global, local, and total local influence of an individual and generalized leverage, are discussed. Moreover, we also derive the normal curvatures of local influence under various perturbation schemes. Finally, simulation results and an application to real data show the usefulness of our results. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadistica e Investigacion Operativa.",Beta distribution; Beta regression; Generalized leverage; Influence diagnostic,,"Atkinson, A.C., (1985) Plots, Transformation and Regression, , Oxford: Clarendon; Cook, R.D., Detection of influential observations in linear regression (1977) Technometrics, 19, pp. 15-18; Cook, R.D., Assessment of local influence (with discussion) (1986) J R Stat Soc B, 48, pp. 133-169; Cox, D.R., Hinkley, D.V., (1974) Theoretical Statistics, , London: Chapman & Hall; Cook, R.D., Weisberg, S., (1982) Residuals and Influence in Regression, , London: Chapman & Hall; Doornik, J.A., (2006) Ox: An Object-Oriented Matrix Language, , London: Timberlake Consultants Press; Espinheira, P.L., Ferrari, S.L.P., Cribari-Neto, F., Influence diagnostics in beta regression (2008) Comput Stat Data Anal, 52, pp. 4417-4431; Espinheira, P.L., Ferrari, S.L.P., Cribari-Neto, F., On beta regression residuals (2008) J Appl Stat, 35, pp. 407-419; Ferrari, S.L.P., Cribari-Neto, F., Beta regression for modeling rates and proportions (2004) J Appl Stat, 31, pp. 799-815; Huet, S., Bouvier, A., Poursat, M.A., Jolivet, E., (2003) Statistical Tools for Nonlinear Regression: A Practical Guide with S-PLUS and R, , Berlin: Springer; Jørgensen, B., (1997) The Theory of Dispersion Models, , London: Chapman & Hall; Kieschnick, R., McCullough, B., Regression analysis of variates observed on (0,1): Percentages, proportions, and fractions (2003) Stat Model, 3, pp. 193-213; Lawrance, A.J., Regression transformation diagnostic using local influence (1988) J Am Stat Assoc, 83, pp. 1067-1072; Leiva, V., Barros, M., Paula, G.A., Galea, M., Influence diagnostics in log-Birnbaum-Saunders regression models with censored data (2007) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51, pp. 5694-5707; Lemonte, A.J., Influence diagnostics in Birnbaum-Saunders nonlinear regression models (2009) Working paper, , arXiv: 0904 4139; Lesaffre, E., Verbeke, G., Local influence in linear mixed model (1998) Biometrics, 54, pp. 570-583; Li, W.K., Testing model adequacy for some Markov regression models for time series (1991) Biometrika, 78, pp. 83-89; McCullagh, P., Nelder, J., (1989) Generalized Linear Models, , 2nd edn., London: Chapman & Hall; Paula, G.A., Assessing local influence in restricted regression models (1993) Comput Stat Data Anal, 16, pp. 63-79; Press, W.H., Teukolsky, S.A., Vetterling, W.T., Flannery, B.P., (1992) Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing, , 2nd edn., New York: Cambridge University Press; Rocha, A.V., Cribari-Neto, F., Beta autoregressive moving average models (2009) Test, 18, pp. 529-545; Simas, A.B., Barreto-Souza, W., Rocha, A.V., Improved estimators for a general class of beta regression models (2010) Comput Stat Data Anal, 54, pp. 348-366; Thomas, W., Cook, R.D., Assessing influence on predictions from generalized linear models (1990) Technometrics, 32, pp. 59-65; Verbeke, G., Molenberghs, G., (2000) Linear Mixed Models for Longitudinal Data, , New York: Springer; Wei, B.C., (1998) Exponential Family Nonlinear Models, , Singapore: Springer; Wei, B.C., Hu, Y.Q., Fung, W.K., Generalized leverage and its applications (1998) Scand J Stat, 25, pp. 25-37",English,Article

In such situations, an objective of interest is about the occurrence of some events that can occur multiple times or repeatedly and the studies resulting in this type of information are often referred to as event history studies. There are many fields such as medical studies, reliability experiments and social sciences wherein panel count data are encountered commonly. This article reviews basic concepts about panel count data, some common issues and questions of interest regarding them as well as the corresponding statistical procedures that are suitable for their analysis. In particular, we will discuss an estimation of the mean function of the underlying counting process characterizing the occurrence of the events, comparison of several processes and analysis of multiple state panel count data. Some discussion is also presented of situations involving dependent or informative observation processes. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian estimation; Generalized least-squares; Markov model; Mean function; Nonparametric comparison; Nonparametric maximum likelihood; Nonparametric maximum pseudo-likelihood; Panel count data; Rate function,,"Aalen, O.O., (1975) Statistical Inference for a Family of Counting Presses, , Berkeley: PhD Thesis.

As well, the skew-t distribution is generated by a perturbation of symmetry of the basic Student's t density. These families share some nice properties. In particular, they allow a continuous variation through different degrees of asymmetry and, in the case of the skew-t, tail thickness, but still retain relevant features of the perturbed symmetric densities. In both models, a problem occurs in the estimation of the skewness parameter: for small and moderate sample sizes, the maximum likelihood method gives rise to an infinite estimate with positive probability, even when the sample skewness is not too large. To get around this phenomenon, we consider the minimum Hellinger distance estimation technique as an alternative to maximum likelihood. The method always leads to a finite estimate of the shape parameter. Furthermore, the procedure is asymptotically efficient under the assumed model and allows for testing hypothesis and setting confidence regions in a standard fashion. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadistica e Investigacion Operativa.",Estimating function; Hellinger distance; Maximum likelihood; Nonparametric density estimate; Skew-normal; Skew-t,,"Azzalini, A., A class of distributions which includes the normal ones (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Azzalini, A., Further results on a class of distributions which includes the normal ones (1986) Statistica, XLVI, pp. 199-208; Azzalini, A., The skew-normal distribution and related multivariate families (with discussion by M Genton and a rejoinder by the author) (2005) Scand J Stat, 32, pp. 159-198; Azzalini, A., Capitanio, A., Statistical applications of the multivariate skew normal distributions (1999) J R Stat Soc B, 61, pp. 579-602; Azzalini, A., Capitanio, A., Distributions generated by perturbation of symmetry with emphasis on a multivariate skew-t distribution (2003) J R Stat Soc B, 65, pp. 367-389; Azzalini, A., Genton, M.G., Robust likelihood methods based on the skew-t and related distributions (2008) Int Stat Rev, 76, pp. 106-129; Basu, A., Lindsay, B.G., Minimum disparity estimation in the continuous case: Efficiency, distributions, robustness (1994) Ann Inst Stat Math, 46, pp. 683-705; Basu, A., Harris, I.R., Hjort, N., Jones, M., Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence (1998) Biometrika, 85, pp. 549-559; Beran, R.J., Minimum Hellinger distance estimates for parametric models (1977) Ann Stat, 5, pp. 445-463; Bowman, A.W., Azzalini, A., (1997) Applied Smoothing Techniques for Data Analysis, , New York: Oxford University Press; Branco, M.D., Dey, D.K., A general class of multivariate skew-elliptical distributions (2001) J Multivar Anal, 79, pp. 99-113; Cabras, S., Racugno, W., Ventura, L., (2006) Bayesian inference on the scalar skew-normal distribution, , 17th compstat symposium of the IASC, Rome; Chiogna, M., A note on the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator for the scalar skew-normal distribution (2005) Stat Methods Appl, 14, pp. 331-341; Cutler, A., Corder-Brana, O., Minimum Hellinger distance estimation for finite mixture models (1996) J Am Stat Assoc, 91, pp. 1716-1723; Diciccio, T.J., Monti, A.C., Inferential aspects of the skew exponential power distribution (2004) J Am Stat Assoc, 99, pp. 439-450; Firth, D., Bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates (1993) Biometrika, 80, pp. 27-38; Genton, M.G., (2004) Skew-Elliptical Distributions and Their Applications: A Journey beyond Normality, , London: Chapman & Hall/CRC; Hampel, F.R., Ronchetti, E.M., Rousseeuw, P., Stahel, W., (2005) Robust Statistics.

Then, we show how near-exact distributions for the logarithms of these statistics may be expressed as Generalized Near-Integer Gamma distributions or mixtures of these distributions, whose rate parameters associated with the integer shape parameters, for samples of size n, all have the form (n-j)/n for j=2,...,p, where for three of the statistics, p is the number of variables involved, while for the other one, it is the sum of the number of variables involved and the number of mean vectors being tested. What is interesting is that the similarities exhibited by these statistics are even more striking in terms of near-exact distributions than in terms of exact distributions. Moreover all the l. r. t. statistics that may be built as products of these basic statistics also inherit a similar structure for their near-exact distributions. To illustrate this fact, an application is made to the l. r. t. statistic to test the equality of several multivariate Normal distributions. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadistica e Investigacion Operativa.",Generalized Integer Gamma distribution; Generalized Near-Integer Gamma distribution; Independence test; Mixtures; Sphericity test; Wilks lambda statistic,,"Anderson, T.W., (2003) An Introduction to Multivariate Statistical Analysis, , 3rd edn., New York: Wiley; Anderson, T.W., Fang, K.-T., Inference in multivariate elliptically contoured distributions based on maximum likelihood (1990) Statistical inference in elliptically contoured and related distributions, pp. 201-216. , In: Fang K-T, Anderson TW (eds); Anderson, T.W., Fang, K.-T., Hsu, H., Maximum-likelihood estimates and likelihood-ratio criteria for multivariate elliptically contoured distributions (1986) Can J Stat, 14, pp. 55-59; Aslam, S., Rocke, D.M., A robust testing procedure for the equality of covariance matrices (2005) Comput Stat Data Anal, 49, pp. 863-874; Berry, A., The accuracy of the Gaussian approximation to the sum of independent variates (1941) Trans Am Math Soc, 49, pp. 122-136; Coelho, C.A., (1992) Generalized canonical analysis, , PhD thesis, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Coelho, C.A., The Generalized Integer Gamma distribution-a basis for distributions in Multivariate Statistics (1998) J Multivar Anal, 64, pp. 86-102; Coelho, C.A., The Generalized Near-Integer Gamma distribution: A basis for 'near-exact' approximations to the distributions of statistics which are the product of an odd number of independent Beta random variables (2004) J Multivar Anal, 89, pp. 191-218; Coelho, C.A., The wrapped Gamma distribution and wrapped sums and linear combinations of independent Gamma and Laplace distributions (2007) J Stat Theory Practice, 1, pp. 1-29; Coelho, C.A., Marques, F.J., The advantage of decomposing elaborate hypotheses on covariance matrices into conditionally independent hypotheses in building near-exact distributions for the test statistics (2009) Linear Algebra Appl, 430, pp. 2592-2606; Coelho, C.A., Marques, F.J., Near-exact distributions for the likelihood ratio test statistic for testing equality of several variance-covariance matrices (revisited) (2009) The New University of Lisbon, Mathematics Department, technical report #9/2009, submitted for publication, , http://www.dmat.fct.unl.pt/fct/servlet/DownloadFile?file=1162&sub=investiga&modo=prepub; Coelho, C.A., Marques, F.J., Near-exact distributions for the independence and sphericity likelihood ratio test statistics (2010) J Multivar Anal, 101, pp. 583-593; Coelho, C.A., Alberto, R.P., Grilo, L.M., A mixture of Generalized Integer Gamma distributions as the exact distribution of the product of an odd number of independent Beta random variables: Applications (2006) J Interdiscip Math, 9, pp. 229-248; Esseen, C.-G., Fourier analysis of distribution functions.

First of all, we deal with systems described via one convex inequality and extend the achieved results, by making use of a celebrated scalarization function, to convex inequality systems expressed by means of a general vector function. We also propose a second approach for guaranteeing the existence of global error bounds of the latter, which meanwhile sharpens the classical result of Robinson. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Conjugate functions; Duality in convex programming; Error bounds,,,English,Article in Press

Here, clustering is performed by computing the Voronoi partition associated with centers that minimize an empirical criterion, called distorsion. The performance of the method is evaluated by comparing the theoretical distorsion of empirical optimal centers to the theoretical optimal distorsion. Our first result states that, provided that the underlying distribution satisfies an exponential moment condition, an upper bound for the above performance criterion is {Mathematical expression}. Then, motivated by a broad range of applications, we focus on the case where the data are real-valued random fields. Assuming that they share a Hölder property in quadratic mean, we construct a numerically simple k-means algorithm based on a discretized version of the data. With a judicious choice of the discretization, we prove that the performance of this algorithm matches the performance of the classical algorithm. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Clustering; Empirical risk minimization; Hilbert space; k-means; Random fields; Unsupervised learning,,,English,Article in Press

Such stationary distributions arise in performance evaluation for various queueing systems and their networks. However, it is very hard to obtain them analytically, so our interest is directed to analytically tractable characteristics. For this, we consider tail asymptotics of the stationary distributions. The purpose of this paper is twofold. We first overview the current approaches to attack the problem from a unified viewpoint. We then take up two approaches, Markov additive and analytic function approaches, which are recently developed by the author and his colleagues. We discuss their possible extensions. We mainly consider the tail asymptotics for two-dimensional reflecting processes, but also discuss how we can approach the case of more than two dimensions. © 2011 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Convergence domain; Join the shortest queue; Large deviations; Light tail; Markov additive process; Multidimensional moment generating function; Queueing network; Reflecting random walk; Semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion; Server collaboration; Stability; Stationary distribution; Stationary inequality; Tail asymptotic; Tail decay rate,,,English,Article in Press

The most significant advantage of the proposal is that it avoids the model misspecification problem. The monotonicity is the only assumption about the functional form of the relationship between the variable of interest and the auxiliary one. Estimators for the area means are derived combining ""Order Restricted Inference"" and standard mixed model approaches.

In both cases, estimation is based on a Type II censored sample. In such cases, the predictive density and predictive survival functions of future observables are obtained when based on the two-sample scheme. This enables us to obtain Bayes prediction bounds of future observables. Subjective priors are used which reflect the prior belief of the experimenter. Numerical results are obtained under three exponentiated models and compared with the results obtained by using the MCMC algorithm. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayes prediction; Exponentiated distribution; Maximum likelihood and Bayes estimation; MCMC algorithm; Proportional reversed hazard model; Subjective prior; Two-sample scheme; Type II censoring,,"Abdel-Hamid, A.H., Al-Hussaini, E.K., Estimation in step-stress accelerated life tests for the exponentiated exponential distribution with type-I censoring (2009) Comput Stat Data Anal, 53, pp. 1328-1338; Ahuja, J.C., Nash, S.W., The generalized Gompertz-Verhulst family of distributions (1967) Sankhyā, 29, pp. 141-161; Al-Hussaini, E.K., Predicting observables from a general class of distributions (1999) J Stat Plan Inference, 79, pp. 79-91; Al-Hussaini, E.K., On Bayes prediction of future median (2001) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 30, pp. 1395-1410; Al-Hussaini, E.K., Bayes predictive density of order statistics based on finite mixture models (2003) J Stat Plan Inference, 113, pp. 15-24; AL-Hussaini, E.K., On the exponentiated class of distributions (2010) J Stat Theory Appl, , (to appear); Al-Hussaini, E.K., Ahmad, A.A., On Bayesian predictive distributions of generalized order statistics (2003) Metrika, 57, pp. 165-176; Al-Hussaini, E.K., Ahmad, A.A., On Bayesian interval prediction of future records (2003) Test, 12, pp. 79-99; Al-Hussaini, E.K., Gharib, M., A new family of distributions as a countable mixture with Poisson added parameters (2009) J Stat Theory Appl, 8, pp. 169-190; Al-Hussaini, E.K., Ghitany, M., On certain countable mixtures of absolutely continuous distributions (2005) Metron, LXIII (1), pp. 39-53; Al-Hussaini, E.K., Jaheen, Z.F., Parametric prediction bounds for the future median of the exponential distribution (1999) Statistics, 32, pp. 267-275; Bernardo, J., Smith, A.F.M., (1994) Bayesian Theory, , New York: Wiley; Carlin, B.P., Louis, T.A., (1996) Bayes and Empirical Bayes Methods for Data Analysis, , London: Chapman and Hall; Cowles, M.K., Carlin, B.P., Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence diagnostics: A comparative review (1996) J Am Stat Assoc, 91, pp. 883-904; Davis, D.I., An analysis of some failure date (1952) J Am Stat Assoc, 47, pp. 113-150; Dunsmore, I., The Bayesian predictive distribution in life testing models (1974) Technometrics, 16, pp. 455-460; Efron, B., Logistic regression, survival analysis and the Kaplan-Meier curve (1988) J Am Stat Assoc, 83, pp. 414-425; Gelman, A., Rubin, D.B., Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences (1992) Stat Sci, 7, pp. 457-472; Geisser, S., (1993) Predictive Inference: An Introduction, , London: Chapman and Hall; Guilbaud, O., Non-parametric prediction intervals for sample median in the general case (1983) J Am Stat Assoc, 78, pp. 937-941; Gupta, R.C., Gupta, R.D., Proportional reversed hazard rate model and its applications (2007) J Stat Plan Inference, 137, pp. 3525-3536; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Generalized exponential distribution (1999) Aust NZ J Stat, 41, pp. 173-188; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Generalized exponential distribution: Different methods of estimation (2001) J Stat Comput Simul, 69, pp. 315-337; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Exponentiated exponential family: An alternative to gamma and Weibull distributions (2001) Biom J, 43, pp. 117-130; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Generalized exponential distributions: Statistical inferences (2002) J Stat Theory Appl, 1, pp. 101-118; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Discriminating between the Weibull and the generalized exponential distributions (2003) Comput Stat Data Anal, 43, pp. 179-196; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Closeness of gamma and generalized exponential distributions (2003) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 32, pp. 705-722; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Discriminating between the gamma and the generalized exponential distributions (2004) J Stat Comput Simul, 74, pp. 107-122; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Manglick, A., Probability of correct selection of gamma versus GE or Weibull versus GE based likelihood ratio statistic (2002) Proceedings of Statistics Recent Advances in Statistical Methods, pp. 147-156. , Canada2001, Y.

To this purpose, several techniques have been proposed including comparisons of expected lifetimes or comparisons using stochastic orderings. Recently, Samaniego (System Signatures and Their Applications in Engineering Reliability. International Series in Operations Research & Management Science, vol. 110. Springer, New York, 2007) proposed using stochastic precedence to compare the lifetimes of two independent coherent systems. He proved that if the components in both systems are independent and identically distributed (IID), then these comparisons are distribution free, while comparisons based on expected values are not. In the present paper, we obtain new expressions to compare systems using stochastic precedence without the assumption of IID components. In particular, we show that if the components in both systems are independent and satisfy the Cox proportional hazard rate (PHR) model with the same baseline hazard rate, then these comparisons do not depend on the baseline hazard rate function. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Coherent systems; Exponential distribution; Proportional hazard rate; Signatures; Stochastic precedence,,"Agrawal, A., Barlow, R.E., A survey of network reliability and domination theory (1984) Oper Res, 12, pp. 611-631; Arcones, M.A., Kvam, P.H., Samaniego, F.J., Nonparametric estimation of a distribution subject to a stochastic precedence constraint (2002) J Am Stat Assoc, 97, pp. 170-182; Barlow, R.E., Proschan, F., (1975) Statistical Theory of Reliability and Life Testing, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Boland, P.J., Samaniego, F., The signature of a coherent system and its applications in reliability (2004) Mathematical Reliability: An Expository Perspective, pp. 1-29. , Soyer, Mazzuchi, and Singpurwalla (Eds.), Boston: Kluwer Academic; Hollander, M., Samaniego, F.J., (2006) A Nonparametric, Signature-Based Method for Comparing the Reliability of Arbitrary Systems via Stochastic Precedence, , Technical Report, Department of Statistics, Davis: University of California; Kochar, S., Mukerjee, H., Samaniego, F.J., The ""signature"" of a coherent system and its application to comparison among systems (1999) Nav Res Logist, 46, pp. 507-523; Li, X., Zhang, Z., Some stochastic comparisons of conditional coherent systems (2008) Appl Stoch Models Bus Ind, 24, pp. 541-549; Navarro, J., Tail hazard rate ordering properties of order statistics and coherent systems (2007) Nav Res Logist, 54, pp. 820-828; Navarro, J., Hernandez, P.J., Mean residual life functions of finite mixtures and systems (2008) Metrika, 67, pp. 277-298; Navarro, J., Rubio, R., Computation of signatures of coherent systems with five components (2010) Commun Stat Simul Comput, 39 (1), pp. 1-17; Navarro, J., Rychlik, T., Reliability and expectation bounds for coherent systems with exchangeable components (2007) J Multivar Anal, 98, pp. 102-113; Navarro, J., Shaked, M., Hazard rate ordering of order statistics and systems (2006) J Appl Probab, 43, pp. 391-408; Navarro, J., Ruiz, J.M., Sandoval, C.J., Reliability properties of systems with exchangeable components and exponential conditional distributions (2006) Test, 15 (2), pp. 471-484; Navarro, J., Ruiz, J.M., Sandoval, C.J., Properties of coherent systems with dependent components (2007) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 36, pp. 175-191; Navarro, J., Balakrishnan, N., Samaniego, F.J., Mixture representations of residual lifetimes of used systems (2008) J Appl Probab, 45 (4), pp. 1097-1112; Navarro, J., Samaniego, F.J., Balakrishnan, N., Bhattacharya, D., On the application and extension of system signatures to problems in engineering reliability (2008) Nav Res Logist, 55, pp. 313-327; Navarro, J., Guillamon, A., Ruiz, M.C., Generalized mixtures in reliability modelling: Applications to the construction of bathtub shaped hazard models and the study of systems (2009) Appl Stoch Models Bus Ind, 25 (3), pp. 323-337; Samaniego, F.J., On closure of the IFR class under formation of coherent systems (1985) IEEE Trans Reliab, R-34, pp. 69-72; Samaniego, F.J., (2007) System Signatures and Their Applications in Engineering Reliability, 110. , International series in operations research & management science, New York: Springer; Samaniego, F.J., Balakrishnan, N., Navarro, J., Dynamic signatures and their use in comparing the reliability of new and used systems (2009) Nav Res Logist, 56, pp. 577-591; Shaked, M., Suarez-Llorens, A., On the comparison of reliability experiments based on the convolution order (2003) J Am Stat Assoc, 98, pp. 693-702; Tokarev, D.V., Borovkov, K.A., On the expectations of maxima of sets of independent random variables (2010) Stat Probab Lett, 79, pp. 2381-2388",English,Article

Correspondingly, in recent years there has been a significant amount of research on new statistical methodology for such models. Although descriptive models that approach the problem from the second-order (covariance) perspective are important, and innovative work is being done in this regard, many real-world processes are dynamic, and it can be more efficient in some cases to characterize the associated spatio-temporal dependence by the use of dynamical models. The chief challenge with the specification of such dynamical models has been related to the curse of dimensionality. Even in fairly simple linear, first-order Markovian, Gaussian error settings, statistical models are often over parameterized. Hierarchical models have proven invaluable in their ability to deal to some extent with this issue by allowing dependency among groups of parameters. In addition, this framework has allowed for the specification of science based parameterizations (and associated prior distributions) in which classes of deterministic dynamical models (e. g., partial differential equations (PDEs), integro-difference equations (IDEs), matrix models, and agent-based models) are used to guide specific parameterizations. Most of the focus for the application of such models in statistics has been in the linear case. The problems mentioned above with linear dynamic models are compounded in the case of nonlinear models. In this sense, the need for coherent and sensible model parameterizations is not only helpful, it is essential. Here, we present an overview of a framework for incorporating scientific information to motivate dynamical spatio-temporal models. First, we illustrate the methodology with the linear case. We then develop a general nonlinear spatio-temporal framework that we call general quadratic nonlinearity and demonstrate that it accommodates many different classes of scientific-based parameterizations as special cases. The model is presented in a hierarchical Bayesian framework and is illustrated with examples from ecology and oceanography. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian; Hierarchical; Nonlinear; Quadratic; SST; State-space,,"Andrieu, C., Doucet, A., Holenstein, R., Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (2010) J R Stat Soc, Ser B, 72, pp. 1-33; Barnston, A.G., Glantz, M.H., He, Y., Predictive skill of statistical and dynamical climate models in forecasts of SST during the 1998-1997 El Niño episode and the 1998 La Niña onset (1999) Bull Am Meteorol Soc, 80, pp. 217-244; Barry, R.P., ver Hoef, J., Blackbox kriging: Spatial prediction without specifying variogram models (1996) J Agric Biol Ecol Stat, 1, pp. 297-322; Berliner, L.M., Hierarchical Bayesian time series models (1996) Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods, pp. 15-22. , K.

Gompertz distribution is considered as a lifetime model. The posterior means and posterior variances are derived using the squared-error loss function. The Bayes estimates cannot be obtained in explicit forms. Approximate Bayes estimates are computed using the method of Lindley [D.V. Lindley, Approximate Bayesian methods, Trabajos Estadistica 31 (1980), pp. 223-237]. The advantage of this proposed method is shown. The approximate Bayes estimates obtained under the assumption of non-informative priors are compared with their maximum likelihood counterparts using Monte Carlo simulation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Acceleration factor; Bayesian estimation; Gompertz distribution; Lindley's approximation; Maximum likelihood; Monte Carlo simulation; Non-informative priors; Posterior mean; Posterior variance; Squared-error loss function; Step-stress test; Type-I censoring,,"Pathak, P.K., Singh, A.K., Zimmer, W.J., Bayes estimation of hazard and acceleration in accelerated testing (1991) IEEETrans.

The separate problems (routing and loading) are already NP-hard, and very difficult to solve in practice. A fortiori their combination is extremely challenging and stimulating. Although the specific literature is still quite limited, a first attempt to a systematic view of this field can be useful both to academic researchers and to practitioners. We review vehicle routing problems with two- and three-dimensional loading constraints. Other combinations of routing and special loading constraints arising from industrial applications are also considered. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Loading; Pickup and delivery; Three-dimensional packing; Traveling salesman; Two-dimensional packing; Vehicle routing,,"Applegate, D., Bixby, R.E., Chvátal, V., Cook, W., (2007) The Traveling Salesman: A Computational Study, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Avella, P., Boccia, M., Sforza, A., Solving a fuel delivery problem by heuristic and exact approaches (2004) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 170-179; Baker, B.S., Coffman Jr., E.G., Rivest, R.L., Orthogonal packing in two dimensions (1980) SIAM J Comput, 9, pp. 846-855; Baldacci, R., Mingozzi, A., A unified exact method for solving different classes of vehicle routing problems (2009) Math Program, 120, pp. 347-380; Baldacci, R., Toth, P., Vigo, D., Recent advances in vehicle routing exact algorithms (2007) 4OR, Q J Oper Res, 5, pp. 269-298; Baldacci, R., Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., An exact algorithm for the vehicle routing problem based on the set partitioning formulation with additional cuts (2008) Math Program, 115, pp. 351-385; Baldacci, R., Toth, P., Vigo, D., Exact algorithms for routing problems under vehicle capacity constraints (2010) Operations Research II, Invited Surveys from 4OR, 2006-2008, 175, pp. 213-245. , Annals of operations research, D.

Indeed, MARS denotes a modern methodology from statistical learning which is important in both classification and regression, with an increasing number of applications in many areas of science, economy and technology. It is very useful for high-dimensional problems and shows a great promise for fitting nonlinear multivariate functions. The MARS algorithm for estimating the model function consists of two algorithms, these are the forward and the backward stepwise algorithm. In our paper, we propose not to use the backward stepwise algorithm. Instead, we construct a penalized residual sum of squares for MARS as a Tikhonov regularization problem which is also known as ridge regression. We treat this problem using continuous optimization techniques which we consider to become an important complementary technology and model-based alternative to the concept of the backward stepwise algorithm. In particular, we apply the elegant framework of conic quadratic programming. This is an area of convex optimization which is very well-structured, herewith, resembling linear programming and, hence, permitting the use of powerful interior point methods. Based on these theoretical and algorithmical studies, this paper also contains an application to diabetes data. We evaluate and compare the performance of the established MARS and our new CMARS in classifying diabetic persons, where CMARS turns out to be very competitive and promising. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Classification; Clustering; Conic quadratic programming; Continuous optimization; Curvature; Interior point methods; MARS; Penalty methods; Regression; Statistical learning; Well-structured convex problems,,,English,Article in Press

We propose an ℓ1-penalized maximum likelihood estimator in an appropriate parameterization. This kind of estimation belongs to a class of problems where optimization and theory for non-convex functions is needed. This distinguishes itself very clearly from high-dimensional estimation with convex loss- or objective functions as, for example, with the Lasso in linear or generalized linear models. Mixture models represent a prime and important example where non-convexity arises. For FMR models, we develop an efficient EM algorithm for numerical optimization with provable convergence properties. Our penalized estimator is numerically better posed (e. g., boundedness of the criterion function) than unpenalized maximum likelihood estimation, and it allows for effective statistical regularization including variable selection. We also present some asymptotic theory and oracle inequalities: due to non-convexity of the negative log-likelihood function, different mathematical arguments are needed than for problems with convex losses. Finally, we apply the new method to both simulated and real data. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Adaptive Lasso; Finite mixture models; Generalized EM algorithm; High-dimensional estimation;

We derive the relevant formulas for the combined ordered samples to construct confidence intervals for a given quantile, prediction intervals, and tolerance intervals. The results are valid for every continuous distribution function. The key results are the derivations of the marginal distribution functions in the combined ordered samples. In the case of ordinary Type-II right censored order statistics, it is shown that the combined ordered sample is no longer distributed as order statistics.

In this paper we propose within a Bayesian framework a new modeling strategy for inference on the unknown population size in the presence of heterogeneity of subject characteristics. Our approach is attractive in that parameters are easily interpretable. Moreover, no parametric distributional assumptions are imposed on the latent distribution of individual heterogeneous propensities to be captured. Bayesian inference based on marginal likelihood by-passes some common identifiability issues, and a formal default prior distribution can be derived. Alternative default prior choices are considered and compared.

Using the Laplace expansion for integrals, some approximations to the most powerful invariant (MPI) tests are derived. The cases of bivariate exponential and bivariate uniform alternatives are studied in detail, whereas higher-dimensional extensions are only outlined. Those alternatives are irregular and need a special treatment because of the dependence of their supports on the unknown parameters. It is shown that likelihood ratio (LR) tests are asymptotically equivalent to the MPI tests. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that the powers of the LR tests are very close to the powers of the MPI tests, even in small samples. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Invariant test; Laplace expansion; Likelihood ratio test; Tests for multinormality,,"Andersson, S., Distributions of maximal invariants using quotient measures (1982) Ann Stat, 10, pp. 955-961; Arnold, B.C., Balakrishnan, N., (1989) Relations, Bounds and Approximations for Order Statistics, 53. , Lecture notes in statistics, Heidelberg: Springer; Barbe, P., Limiting distribution of the minimal spacing (1993) Math Methods Stat, 3, pp. 306-325; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Cox, D.R., (1989) Asymptotic Techniques for Use in Statistics, , London: Chapman and Hall; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Cox, D.R., (1994) Inference and Asymptotics, , London: Chapman and Hall; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Jupp, P.E., Differential geometry, profile likelihood, L-sufficiency and composite transformation models (1988) Ann Stat, 16, pp. 1009-1043; Barndorff-Nielsen, O.E., Blæsild, P., Eriksen, P.S., (1989) Decomposition and Invariance of Measures with a View to Statistical Transformation Models, 58. , Lecture Notes in Statistics, Heidelberg: Springer; Bleistein, N., Handelsman, R.A., (1975) Asymptotic Expansions of Integrals, , New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston; Ducharme, G.R., Frichot, B., Quasi-most powerful invariant goodness-of-fit tests (2003) Scand J Stat, 30, pp. 399-414; Eaton, M.L., (1983) Multivariate Statistics, , A vector space approach, New York: Wiley; Fisher, R.A., The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems (1936) Ann Eugen, 7 II, pp. 179-188; Henze, N., Invariant tests for multivariate normality: A critical review (2002) Stat Pap, 43, pp. 467-506; Mann, H.B., Wald, A., On stochastic limit and order relationship (1943) Ann Math Stat, 14, pp. 217-226; Mardia, K.V., Measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis with applications (1970) Biometrika, 57, pp. 519-530; Pace, L., Salvan, A., (1997) Principles of Statistical Inference, , Singapore: World Scientific; Pace, L., Salvan, A., Ventura, L., Likelihood-based discrimination between separate scale and regression models (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 3539-3553; Press, W.H., Teukolsky, S.A., Vetterling, W.T., Flannery, B.P., Numerical recipies in C (1995) The Art of Scientific Computing, , 2nd edn, New York: Cambridge University Press; Serfling, R.J., (1980) Approximation Theorems of Mathematical Statistics, , New York: Wiley; Shun, Z., McCullagh, P., Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals (1995) J R Stat Soc B, 57, pp. 749-760; Szkutnik, Z., On invariant tests for multidimensional normality (1987) Probab Math Stat, 8, pp. 1-10; Szkutnik, Z., Most powerful invariant tests for binormality (1988) Ann Stat, 16, pp. 292-301; Szkutnik, Z., Special capacities, the Hunt-Stein theorem and transformation groups (1992) Ann Stat, 20, pp. 1120-1128",English,Article

Often a reasonable assumption is that the data are generated by the trajectories of a smooth underlying stochastic process. In some cases, one observes multivariate time courses generated by a multivariate stochastic process. To understand the nature of the underlying processes, it is then of interest to relate the values of a process at one time with the value it assumes at another time, and also to relate the values assumed by different components of a multivariate trajectory at the same time or at specific times selected for each trajectory. In addition, an assessment of these relationships will allow to predict future values of an individual's trajectories. Derivatives of the trajectories are frequently more informative than the time courses themselves, for instance, in the case of growth curves. It is then of great interest to study the estimation of derivatives from sparse data. Such estimation procedures permit the study of time-dynamic relationships between derivatives and trajectory levels within the same trajectory and between the components of multivariate trajectories. Reviewing and extending recent work, we demonstrate the estimation of corresponding empirical dynamical systems and demonstrate asymptotic consistency of predictions and dynamic transfer functions. We illustrate the resulting prediction procedures and empirical first-order differential equations with a study of the dynamics of longitudinal functional data for the relationship of blood pressure and body mass index. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Derivatives;

As well, the skew-t distribution is generated by a perturbation of symmetry of the basic Student's t density. These families share some nice properties. In particular, they allow a continuous variation through different degrees of asymmetry and, in the case of the skew-t, tail thickness, but still retain relevant features of the perturbed symmetric densities. In both models, a problem occurs in the estimation of the skewness parameter: for small and moderate sample sizes, the maximum likelihood method gives rise to an infinite estimate with positive probability, even when the sample skewness is not too large. To get around this phenomenon, we consider the minimum Hellinger distance estimation technique as an alternative to maximum likelihood. The method always leads to a finite estimate of the shape parameter.

Furthermore, the extremal behavior of periodic integer-valued moving average sequences is also considered. In this case, we find that, when assessing their clustering tendency of high-threshold exceedances, the extremal index is the same as for the stationary case. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Binomial thinning; Extremal index; Extreme value theory; Integer-valued sequences,,"Anderson, C.W., Extreme value theory for a class of discrete distributions with applications to some stochastic processes (1970) J Appl Probab, 7, pp. 99-113; Brännäs, K., Hall, A., Estimation in integer-valued moving average models (2001) Appl Stoch Models Bus Ind, 17, pp. 277-291; Brännäs, K., Hellström, J., Tourist accommodation effects of festivals (2006) Tour Econ, 12, pp. 291-302; Chernick, M., Hsing, T., McCormick, W., Calculating the extremal index for a class of stationary sequences (1991) Adv Appl Probab, 23, pp. 835-850; Embrechts, P., Klüppelberg, C., Mikosch, T., (1997) Modelling Extremal Events for Insurance and Finance, , Berlin: Springer; Feller, W., (1971) An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, II. , New York: Wiley; de Haan, L., An Abel-Tauber theorem for Laplace transforms (1976) J Lond Math Soc, 13, pp. 537-542; Hall, A., Extremes of integer-valued moving averages models with regularly varying tails (2001) Extremes, 4, pp. 219-239; Hall, A., Scotto, M.G., Extremes of periodic integer-valued sequences with exponential type tails (2006) Revstat, 4, pp. 249-273; Hipel, K.W., McLeod, A.I., (1994) Time Series Modelling of Water Resources and Environmental Systems, , Amsterdam: Elsevier; Macdonald, I., Zucchini, W., (1997) Hidden Markov and Other Models for Discrete-Valued Time Series, , London: Chapman & Hall; Martins, A.P., Ferreira, H., Extremes of periodic moving averages of random variables with varying tail probabilities (2004) Sort, 28, pp. 161-176; McCormick, W.P., Park, Y.S., Asymptotic analysis of extremes from autoregressive negative binomial processes (1992) J Appl Probab, 29, pp. 904-920; Quoreshi, A.M.M.S., Bivariate time series modelling of financial count data (2006) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 35, pp. 1343-1358; Resnick, S., (1987) Extreme Values, Regular Variation, and Point Processes, , New York: Springer; Tucker, H., (1967) A Graduate Course in Probability, , New York: Academic Press; Weiß, C.H., Thinning operations for modelling time series of counts-a survey (2008) Adv Stat Anal, 92, pp. 319-341",English,Article

The generalization is based on a multidimensional statistical model of multimodal functions constructed by generalizing computationally favorable properties of a popular one-dimensional model-the Wiener process. A simplicial partition of a feasible region is essential for the construction of the model. The basic idea of the proposed method is to search where improvements of the objective function are most probable; a probability of improvement is evaluated with respect to the statistical model.

One type of such fragments are promoters, i.e., short regulatory DNA sequences located upstream of a gene. Detection of regulatory DNA sequences is important for successful gene prediction and gene expression studies. In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification of DNA sequences and recognition of the regulatory sequences. For optimal classification, various SVM learning and kernel parameters (hyperparameters) and their optimization methods are analyzed. In a case study, optimization of the SVM hyperparameters for linear, polynomial and power series kernels is performed using a modification of the Nelder-Mead (downhill simplex) algorithm. The method allows for improving the precision of identification of the regulatory DNA sequences. The results of promoter recognition for the drosophila sequence datasets are presented. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bioinformatics; Machine learning; Promoter recognition; Support Vector Machine; SVM parameter optimization,,"Ali, S., Smith, K.A., Automatic parameter selection for polynomial kernel (2003) Proc of the IEEE int conf on information reuse and integration (IRI 2003), 2003, pp. 243-249. , October 27-29, Las Vegas, NV, USA; Ancona, N., Cicirelli, G., Stella, E., Distante, A., Object detection in images: Run-time complexity and parameter selection of Support Vector Machines (2002) Proc of the 16th int conf on pattern recognition (ICPR'02), 2, pp. 426-429. , 11-15 August 2002, Quebec, Canada; Ayat, N.E., Cheriet, M., Suen, C.Y., Empirical error based optimization of SVM kernels: Application to digit image recognition (2002) Proc of the 8th int workshop on frontiers in handwriting recognition (IWFHR'02), p. 292. , August 6-8, 2002; Boardman, M., Trappenberg, T., A heuristic for free parameter optimization with Support Vector Machines (2006) Proc of IEEE int joint conf on neural networks (IJCNN 2006), pp. 1337-1344. , July 16-21, 2006, Vancouver, Canada; Brunak, S., Engelbrecht, J., Knudsen, S., Prediction of human mRNA donor and acceptor sites from the DNA sequence (1991) J Mol Biol, 220, pp. 49-65; Cassabaum, M.L., Waagen, D.E., Rodriguez, J.J., Schmitt, H.A., Unsupervised optimization of Support Vector Machine parameters (2004) Automatic target recognition XIV.

An integer programming formulation that yields tight LP bounds is proposed. Given that the computational effort required to obtain the LP bounds considerably increases with the size of the instances when using commercial solvers, we propose a Lagrangean relaxation that exploits the structure of the formulation. Since feasible solutions to the Lagrangean function are spanning trees, upper bounds are also obtained. These bounds are later improved with a simple local search. Computational experiments have been run on several benchmark instances from the literature. The results confirm the interest of the proposal since tight lower and upper bounds are obtained, for instances up to 100 nodes, in competitive computational times. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Heuristics; Lagrangean relaxation; Network design,,"Ahuja, R., Murty, V., Exact and heuristic algorithms for the optimum communication spanning tree problem (1987) Transp Sci, 21, pp. 163-170; Balakrishnan, A., Magnanti, T., Wong, R., A dual-ascent procedure for large-scale uncapacitated network design (1989) Oper Res, 37, pp. 716-740; Contreras, I., Fernández, E., Marín, A., Tight bounds from a path based formulation for the tree of hubs location problem (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36, pp. 3117-3127; Contreras, I., Fernández, E., Marín, A., The tree of hubs location problem (2009) Eur J Oper Res, , doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2009.05.044; Fischer, T., Merz, P., A memetic algorithm for the optimum communication spanning tree problem (2007) HM 2007: 4th International Workshop on Hybrid Metaheuristics, 4771, pp. 170-184. , Dortmund, Germany, T.

For this purpose, binary and Gray encodings of the decision variables are tested. Uniform and two-point crossover schemes are evaluated for two different crossover probabilities. Analysis is performed for two P&T system optimization scenarios. Results show that uniform crossover operator with Gray encoding outperforms the other alternatives for the complex problem with higher number of decision variables. On the other hand, when a simpler problem, which had a lower number of decision variables, is solved, the efficiency of GA is independent of the encoding and crossover schemes. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Binary coding; Genetic algorithms; Gray coding; Optimization; Two-point crossover; Uniform crossover,,"Aksoy, A., Culver, T.B., Impact of physical and chemical heterogeneities on aquifer remediation design (2004) J Water Resour Plan Manag, 130, pp. 311-320; Andre, J., Siarry, P., Dognon, T., An improvement of the standard genetic algorithm fighting premature convergence in continuous optimization (2001) Adv Eng Softw, 32, pp. 49-60; Ashlock, D., (2000) Evolutionary Computation for Modeling and Optimization, , New York: Springer; Bethke, A.D., (1981) Genetic algorithms as function optimizers, , Dissertation, Univ of Michigan; Caruana, R.A., Schaffer, J.D., Representation and hidden bias: Gray vs. binary coding for genetic algorithms (1988) Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 153-161. , J.

The variables y and x are not directly measurable, but observed with measurement error. The classical approach to estimate the multivariate errors in variables model is based on an eigenvector analysis of the joint covariance matrix of the observations. In this paper, a projection-pursuit approach is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters. The focus is on projection indices based on half-samples. These lead to robust estimators which can be computed using fast algorithms. Fisher consistency of the procedure is shown, without the need to make distributional assumptions on the x-variables. A simulation study gives insight into the robustness and the efficiency of the procedure. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Errors in variables; Multivariate statistics; Principal components; Projection-pursuit; Robustness,,"Brown, M., Robust line estimation with errors in both variables (1982) J Am Stat Assoc, 77, pp. 71-79; Butler, R.W., Davies, P.L., Jhun, M., Asymptotic for the minimum covariance determinant estimators (1993) Ann Stat, 21, pp. 1385-1400; Cheng, C.L., van Ness, J.W., Generalized M-estimators for errors-in variables regression (1992) Ann Stat, 20, pp. 385-397; Cheng, C.L., van Ness, J.W., Robust calibration (1997) Technometrics, 38, pp. 401-411; Croux, C., Haesbroeck, G., Influence function and efficiency of the minimum covariance determinant scatter matrix estimator (1999) J Multivar Anal, 71, pp. 161-190; Croux, C., Haesbroeck, G., Principal component analysis based on robust estimators of the covariance or correlation matrix: Influence function and efficiencies (2000) Biometrika, 87, pp. 603-618; Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Gordaliza, A., Matran, C., Trimmed k-means: An attempt to robustify quantizers (1997) Ann Stat, 25, pp. 553-576; Fekri, M., Ruiz-Gazen, A., Robust weighted orthogonal regression in the errors-in-variables model (2004) J Multivar Anal, 88, pp. 89-108; Fuller, W.A., (1987) Measurements Errors Models, , New York: Wiley; Fuller, W.A., Errors-in-variables model (1999) Encyclopedia of Statistical Science, Update, 3, pp. 213-216. , S.

This can be done either by using the Marshall and Olkin (Biometrika 84(3), 641-652, 1997) scheme and adding a parameter to the geometric distribution or by starting with the generalized exponential distribution in Marshall and Olkin (Biometrika 84(3), 641-652, 1997) and discretizing this continuous distribution. The particular case α=1 led us to the geometric distribution. After reviewing some of its properties, we investigated the question of parameter estimation. The new distribution is unimodal with a failure rate that is monotonically increasing or decreasing, depending on the value of the parameter α. Expected frequencies were calculated for two overdispersed and infradispersed examples, and the distribution was found to provide a very satisfactory fit. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigacín Operativa.",Branching process; Discretizing; Failure rate; Fitting; Geometric distribution,,"Andrews, G.E., Askey, R., Roy, R., (1999) Special Functions, , Encyclopedia of mathematics and its applications, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Consul, P.C., Jain, G.C., A generalization of the Poisson distribution (1973) Technometrics, 15 (4), pp. 791-799; Farrington, C.P., Grant, D., The distribution of time to extinction in subcritical branching process: Applications to outbreak of infectious disease (1999) J Appl Probab, 36, pp. 771-779; Gupta, P.L., Gupta, R.C., Tripathi, R.C., On the monotonic properties of discrete failure rates (1997) J Stat Plan Inference, 65, pp. 255-268; Gupta, P.L., Gupta, R.C., Ong, S.-H., Srivastava, H.M., A class of Hurwitz-Lerch zeta distributions and their applications in reliability (2008) Appl Math Comput, 196, pp. 521-531; Irwin, J.O., The place of mathematics in medical and biological statistics (1963) J R Stat Soc Ser A, 126, pp. 1-44; Jain, G.C., Consul, P.C., A generalized negative binomial distribution (1971) SIAM J Appl Math, 21, pp. 501-513; Jayakumar, K., Mathew, T., On a generalization to Marshall-Olkin scheme and its application to Burr type XII distribution (2008) Stat Pap, 49, pp. 421-439; Johnson, N.L., Kemp, A.W., Kotz, S., (2005) Univariate Discrete Distributions, , 3rd edn., New York: Wiley; Keilson, J., Gerber, H., Some results for discrete unimodality (1971) J Am Stat Assoc, 66 (334), pp. 386-389; Kemp, A.W., Heine-Euler extensions of the Poisson distribution (1992) Commun Stat, Theory Methods, 21 (3), pp. 571-588; Kemp, A.W., The discrete half-normal distribution (2008) Advances in Mathematical and Statistical Modeling, pp. 353-365. , Basel: Birkhäuser; Krishna, H., Singh, P., Discrete Burr and discrete Pareto distributions (2009) Stat Methodol, 6 (2), pp. 177-188; Makčutek, J., A generalization of the geometric distribution and its application in quantitative linguistics (2008) Romanian Rep Phys, 60 (3), pp. 501-509; Marshall, A.W., Olkin, I., A new method for adding a parameter to a family of distributions with application to the exponential and Weibull families (1997) Biometrika, 84 (3), pp. 641-652; McDonald, J.B., Some generalized functions for the size distribution of income (1984) Econometrica, 52, pp. 647-664; Nakagawa, T., Osaki, S., The discrete Weibull distribution (1975) IEE Trans Reliab, 24 (5), pp. 300-301; Philippou, A.N., Georghiou, C., Philippou, G.N., A generalized geometric distribution and some of its properties (1983) Stat Probab Lett, 1, pp. 171-175; Roy, D., Discrete Rayleigh distribution (2004) IEEE Trans Reliab, 53, p. 2. , 255-260; Tripathi, R.C., Gupta, R.C., White, T.J., Some generalizations of the geometric distribution (1987) Sankhyā, Ser B, 49 (3), pp. 218-223; Xie, M., Gaudoin, O., Bracquemond, C., Redefining failure rate function for discrete distributions (2002) Int J Reliab, Qual Saf Eng, 9 (3), pp. 275-285",English,Article

A binary linear programming model is introduced in order to reducing costs. Solving the model for actual size instances is computationally burdensome. Hence, we introduce and implement two heuristic algorithms to reduce the computational time. The heuristics are applied to the real case of the cooperative ""Os Irmandiños"" with a large number of owners and smallholdings.

Most existing models assume that demand is located at specific points within an area and that coverage is evaluated by certain quantifiable criteria. However, in realistic applications, the concept of coverage may also include qualitative aspects. Moreover, the location of the servers may be determined on the basis of more than one objective. In this paper, we present a number of fuzzy goal programming models for demand coverage. We consider three objectives: (a) maximization of total coverage, (b) maximization of minimum coverage, and (c) minimization of distance to servers of uncovered demand points. Through a series of realistic problem instances, we demonstrate that the proposed models provide satisfactory solutions with respect to all three objectives. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Demand coverage; Fuzzy goal programming,,"Aköz, Petrovic, A fuzzy goal programming method with imprecise goal hierarchy (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 181, pp. 1427-1433; Alexandris, G., Giannikos, I., A new model for maximal coverage exploiting GIS capabilities (2010) Eur J Oper Res, 202 (2), pp. 328-338; Araz, C., Selim, H., Ozkarahan, I., A fuzzy multi-objective covering-based vehicle location model for emergency services (2007) Comput Oper Res, 34, pp. 705-726; Brotcorne, L., Laporte, G., Semet, F., Fast heuristics for large scale covering-location problems (2002) Comput Oper Res, 29 (2002), pp. 651-665; Chalam, G.A., Fuzzy goal programming (FGP) approach to a stochastic transportation problem under budgetary constraint (1994) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 66 (3), pp. 293-299; Chanas, S., Kuchta, D., Fuzzy goal programming-one notion, many meanings (2002) Control Cybern, 31 (4), pp. 871-890; Charnes, A., Cooper, W., (1961) Management Models and Industrial Applications of Linear Programming, , New York: Wiley; Chen, L., Tsai, F., Fuzzy goal programming with different importance and priorities (2001) Eur J Oper Res, 133, pp. 548-556; Church, R., Revelle, C., The maximal covering location model (1974) Pap Reg Sci Assoc, 32, pp. 101-118; Church, R.L., Roberts, K.L., Generalized coverage models and public facility location (1983) Pap Reg Sci Assoc, 53, pp. 117-135; Current, J., O'Kelly, M., Locating emergency warning sirens (1992) Decis Sci, 23, pp. 221-234; Darzentas, J., A discrete location model with fuzzy accessibility measures (1987) Fuzzy Sets Syst, 23, pp. 149-154; Daskin, M., (1995) Network and Discrete Location, , New York: Wiley; Daskin, M., Hogan, K., Revelle, C., Integration of multiple, excess, backup and expected covering models (1988) Environ Plann B, Plann Des, 15, pp. 15-35; Dhingra, A.K., Rao, S.S., Multiobjective decision making in a fuzzy environment with applications to helicopter design (1990) AIAA J, 28 (4), pp. 703-710; Eiselt, H.A., Marianov, V., Gradual location set covering with service quality (2009) Socio-Econ Plann Sci, 43, pp. 121-130; Gen, M., Ida, K., Tsujimura, Y., Kim, E., Large-scale 0-1 fuzzy goal programming and its application to reliability optimization problem (1993) Comput Ind Eng, 24 (4), pp. 539-549; Jones, D.F., Tamiz, M., Goal programming in the period 1990-2000 (2002) Multicriteria Optimization: State of the Art Annotated Bibliographic Survey, , M.

Leaving and entering such a curve is allowed at all its points, and hence a network structure is continuously integrated in the plane. This extension gives the chance to model real-world situations like highway networks or other traffic infrastructure. The extension of the Weber problem leads to a nonconvex problem.

It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional data and attempts to discover a nonlinear structure (including manifolds) in high-dimensional data. In practice, the nonlinear manifold learning methods are applied in image processing, text mining, etc. The implementation of the LLE algorithm is fairly straightforward, because the algorithm has only two control parameters: the number of neighbors of each data point and the regularization parameter. The mapping quality is quite sensitive to these parameters. In this paper, we propose a new way of selecting a regularization parameter of a local Gram matrix. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Dimensionality reduction; High-dimensional data visualization; Locally linear embedding; Manifold learning,,"Belkin, M., Niyogi, P., Laplacian eigenmaps for dimensionality reduction and data representation (2003) Neural Comput, 15 (6), pp. 1373-1396; Cristianini, N., Taylor, J.S., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-Based Learning Methods, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; DeCoste, D., Visualizing Mercer kernel feature spaces via kernelized locally linear embeddings (2001) Proceedings of the eighth international conference on neural information processing, , Shanghai, China, 14-18 November 2001; Donoho, D.L., Grimes, C., Hessian eigenmaps: New locally linear embedding techniques for high-dimensional data (2005) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 102 (21), pp. 7426-7431; Dzemyda, G., Visualization of a set of parameters characterized by their correlation matrix (2001) Comput Stat Data Anal, 36 (10), pp. 15-30; Gantmacher, F.R., (1988) The Theory of Matrices, , (in Russian), Moscow: Nauka; Ge, S., Yang, Y., Lee, T.H., Hand gesture recognition and tracking based on distributed locally linear embedding (2006) Proceedings of IEEE conference on robotics, automation and mechatronics, pp. 1-6. , ISBN: 1-4244-0025-2; Hadid, A., Kouropteva, O., Pietikäinen, M., Unsupervised learning using locally linear embedding: experiments with face pose analysis (2002) ICPR, (1), pp. 111-114; Jain, V., Saul, L.K., Exploratory analysis and visualization of speech and music by locally linear embedding (2004) Proceedings of IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing (ICASSP No 29), 5, pp. 984-987. , ISBN: 0-7803-8484-9; Karbauskaite, R., Kurasova, O., Dzemyda, G., Selection of the number of neighbours of each data point for the locally linear embedding algorithm (2007) Inf Technol Control, 36 (4), pp. 359-364. , ISSN 1392-124X.

In today's ever competitive marketplace, offering delay payments has become a commonly adopted method to suppliers. Most of the inventory models with permissible delay in payments assumed that the entire lot size is delivered at the same time. However, in practice, goods ordered are usually arrived overtime in separate batches. In this study, we discuss an inventory problem with a finite replenishment rate under trade credit for two payment methods. We establish a theorem to find the optimal solution for each payment method. Numerical examples are also given to illustrate the solution procedure. Finally, to investigate the effect of changes of some main parameter values on the optimal solution, a sensitivity analysis is performed and some management interpretations are proposed. © 2008 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Finance; Finite replenishment rate; Inventory; Permissible delay in payments,,"Aggarwal, S.P., Jaggi, C.K., Ordering policies of deteriorating items under permissible delay in payments (1995) J Oper Res Soc, 46, pp. 658-662; Chang, C.T., Teng, J.T., Retailer's optimal ordering policy under supplier credits (2004) Math Methods Oper Res, 60, pp. 471-483; Chang, C.T., Ouyang, L.Y., Teng, J.T., An EOQ model for deteriorating items under supplier credits linked to ordering quantity (2003) Appl Math Model, 27, pp. 983-996; Chung, K.J., Huang, Y.F., The optimal cycle time for EPQ inventory model under permissible delay in payments (2003) Int J Prod Econ, 84, pp. 307-318; Chung, K.J., Liao, J.J., Lot-sizing decisions under trade credit depending on the ordering quantity (2004) Comput Oper Res, 31, pp. 909-928; Dave, U., On ""economic order quantity under conditions of permissible delay in payments"" by Goyal (1985) J Oper Res Soc, 36, p. 1069; Davis, R.A., Gaither, N., Optimal ordering policies under conditions of extended payment privileges (1985) Manag Sci, 31, pp. 499-509; Goyal, S.K., Economic order quantity under conditions of permissible delay in payments (1985) J Oper Res Soc, 36, pp. 335-338; Goyal, S.K., Teng, J.T., Chang, C.T., Optimal ordering policies when the supplier provides a progressive interest scheme (2007) Eur J Oper Res, 179, pp. 404-413; Huang, Y.F., Optimal retailer's ordering policies in the EOQ model under trade credit financing (2003) J Oper Res Soc, 54, pp. 1011-1015; Huang, Y.F., Optimal retailer's replenishment policy for the EPQ model under the supplier's trade credit policy (2004) Prod Plan Control, 15, pp. 27-33; Hwang, H., Shinn, S.W., Retailer's pricing and lot sizing policy for exponentially deteriorating products under the condition of permissible delay in payments (1997) Comput Oper Res, 24, pp. 539-547; Jamal, A.M., Sarker, B.R., Wang, S., An ordering policy for deteriorating items with allowable shortage and permissible delay in payment (1997) J Oper Res Soc, 48, pp. 826-833; Liao, H.C., Tsai, C.H., Su, C.T., An inventory model with deteriorating items under inflation when a delay in payment is permissible (2000) Int J Prod Econ, 63, pp. 207-214; Mandal, B.N., Phaujdar, S., Some EOQ models under permissible delay in payments (1989) Int J Manag Sci, 5 (2), pp. 99-108; Ouyang, L.Y., Chang, C.T., Teng, J.T., An EOQ model for deteriorating items under trade credits (2005) J Oper Res Soc, 56 (6), pp. 719-726; Ouyang, L.Y., Teng, J.T., Chen, L.H., Optimal ordering policy for deteriorating items with partial backlogging under permissible delay in payments (2006) J Glob Optim, 34, pp. 245-271; Sarker, B.R., Jamal, A.M., Wang, S., Optimal payment time under permissible delay in payment for products with deterioration (2000) Prod Plan Control, 11, pp. 380-390; Shah, N.H., A lot-size model for exponentially decaying inventory when delay in payments is permissible (1993) Cah CERO, 35, pp. 115-123; Shah, N.H., Probabilistic time-scheduling model for an exponentially decaying inventory when delays in payments are permissible (1993) Int J Prod Econ, 32, pp. 77-82; Stevenson, W.J., (1996) Production/Operations Management, , New York: Von Hoffman Press; Taylor Iii, B.W., (1999) Introduction to Management Science, , Englewood-Cliffs: Prentice-Hall; Teng, J.T., On the economic order quantity under conditions of permissible delay in payments (2002) J Oper Res Soc, 53, pp. 915-918; Teng, J.T., Chang, C.T., Goyal, S.K., Optimal pricing and ordering policy under permissible delay in payments (2005) Int J Prod Econ, 97 (2), pp. 121-129",English,Article

The asymptotic properties of the residual sample autocorrelations are derived. It is shown that the asymptotic distribution can be quite different for models with iid innovations and models in which the innovations are nonindependent. Consequently, the usual chi-square distribution does not provide an adequate approximation of the distribution of the Box-Pierce goodness-of-fit portmanteau statistic in the presence of nonindependent innovations. We thus propose modified portmanteau and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests whose asymptotic distributions are a weighted sums of independent chi-squared random variables.

For this, we draw a fixed number of sample observations from one of the populations(say, control) and random number of observations from other populations (say, treatments) using suitable stopping rules. At each stage, two types of control groups, termed as fixed control group (FCG) and updated control group (UCG), are considered. Suitable stopping rules are constructed based on quantiles of the FCG and UCG observations separately. At each stage, FCG consists of initial control observations only; while UCG consists of stage-wise updated combined control observations and previous treatment observations. We examined different large sample results of the proposed tests. We also performed numerical studies to compare the performance of the tests based on FCG and UCG procedures. In addition, we compared the performance of the progressive censoring test procedures with the corresponding competitive terminal test procedure numerically. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Distribution-free; Fixed control group procedure; Inverse sampling; Multi-sample problem; Partially sequential tests; Progressive censoring; Updated control group procedure,,"Alvarez-Andrade, S., Balakrishnan, N., Bordes, L., Homogeneity tests based on several progressively Type-II censored samples (2007) J Multivar Anal, 98 (6), pp. 1195-1213; Alvarez-Andrade, S., Bordes, L., Empirical quantile process under Type-II progressive censoring (2004) Stat Probab Lett, 68, pp. 111-123; Anderson, T.W., The integral of a symmetric unimodal function over a symmetric convex set and some probability inequalities (1955) Proc Am Math Soc, 6, pp. 170-176; Anderson, T.W., A modification of the sequential probability ratio test to reduce the sample size (1960) Ann Math Stat, 31, pp. 165-197; Balakrishnan, N., Progressive censoring methodology: An appraisal (2007) Test, 16, pp. 211-296; Balakrishnan, N., Bordes, L., Non-parametric hazard rate estimation under progressive Type-II censoring (2004) Advances in Survival Analysis, 23, pp. 227-249. , Handbook of statistics, N.

The effects of the ""majority dictatorship"" are restricted.

Moreover, we adopt a bi-objective model for the problem. First, the cost for building and operating the network is to be minimized. Second, the obnoxious effect caused by the reverse network facilities is also to be minimized. A two-stage stochastic bi-objective mixed-integer programming formulation is proposed, in which the strategic decisions are considered in the first stage and the tactical/operational decisions in the second one. A set of different scenarios is considered, and the extensive form of the deterministic equivalent problem is presented. This model is tested with a case study based on some data from the Spanish province of Cordoba. Nondominated solutions are obtained by combining the two different objectives and by using a general solver. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Multicriteria optimization; Reverse logistics; Stochastic programming,,"Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L., Garín, A., Ortuño, M., Pérez, G., An approach for strategic supply chain planning under uncertainty based on stochastic 0-1 programming (2003) J Glob Optim, 26, pp. 97-124; Barros, A., Dekker, R., Scholten, V., A two-level network for recycling sand: A case study (1998) Eur J Oper Res, 110, pp. 199-214; Birge, J., Louveaux, F., (1997) Introduction to Stochastic Programming, , Springer series in operations research, New York: Springer; Dekker, R., van Wassenhove, L., Indurfurth, K., (2004) Reverse Logistics, , New York: Springer; (2007), http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/weee/index_en.htm, European Union WEEE Directive, WebsiteFleischmann, M., Bloemhof-Ruwaard, J., Dekker, R., van der Laan, E., van Nunen, J., van Wassenhove, L., Quantitative models for reverse logistics: A review (1997) Eur J Oper Res, 103, pp. 1-17; Guillén, G., Mele, F., Bagajewicz, M., Espuña, A., Puigjaner, L., Multiobjective supply chain design under uncertainty (2005) Chem Eng Sci, 60, pp. 1535-1553; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Scenario reduction algorithms in stochastic programming (2003) Comput Algorithms Appl, 24, pp. 187-206; Heitsch, H., Römisch, W., Scenario tree modeling for multistage stochastic programs (2009) Math Program Ser A, 118, pp. 371-406; Hoyland, K., Wallace, W., Generating scenario trees for multi-stage decision problems (2001) Manag Sci, 47, pp. 295-307; (2006) ILOG CPLEX User's Manual, , http://cplex.ilog.com, ILOG, ILOG, Inc, Incline Village, Nevada; Jayaraman, V., Guide Jr., V.D.R., Srivastava, R., A closed-loop logistics model for remanufacturing (1999) J Oper Res Soc, 50, pp. 497-508; Jayaraman, V., Patterson, R., Rolland, E., The design of reverse distribution networks: Models and solution procedures (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 150, pp. 128-149; Lieckens, K., Vandaele, N., Reverse logistics network design with stochastic lead times (2007) Comput Oper Res, 34, pp. 395-416; Listeş, O., Dekker, R., A stochastic approach to a case study for product recovery network design (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 160, pp. 268-287; Lu, Z., Bostel, N., A facility location model for logistics systems including reverse flows: The case of remanufacturing activities (2007) Comput Oper Res, 34, pp. 299-323; Melo, M., Nickel, S., Saldanha da Gama, F., Facility location and supply chain management-a review (2009) Eur J Oper Res, 196, pp. 401-412; Min, H., Ko, C., Ko, H., The spatial and temporal consolidation of returned products in a closed-loop supply chain network (2006) Comput Ind Eng, 51, pp. 309-320; Min, H., Ko, H., Ko, C., A genetic algorithm approach to developing the multi-echelon reverse logistics network for product returns (2006) Omega, 34, pp. 56-69; Möller, A., Römisch, W., Weber, K., A new approach to (o-d) revenue management based on scenario trees (2004) J Revenue Pricing Manag, 3, pp. 265-276; Pati, R., Vrat, P., Kumar, P., A goal programming model for paper recycling system (2008) Omega, 36, pp. 405-417; Rockafellar, R., Wets, R., Scenarios and policy aggregation in optimization under uncertainty (1991) Math Oper Res, 16, pp. 119-147; Ross, G.T., Soland, R.M., A multicriteria approach to the location of public facilities (1980) Eur J Oper Res, 4, pp. 307-321; Santoso, T., Ahmed, S., Goetschalckx, M., Shapiro, A., A stochastic programming approach for supply chain network design under uncertainty (2005) Eur J Oper Res, 167, pp. 96-115; Schultmann, F., Engels, B., Rentz, O., Closed-loop supply chains for spent batteries (2003) Interfaces, 33, pp. 57-71; Schütz, P., Tomasgard, A., Ahmed, S., Supply chain design under uncertainty using sample average approximation and dual decomposition (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 119, pp. 409-419; Srivastava, S., Network design for reverse logistics (2008) Omega, 36, pp. 535-548; Xu, N., Nozick, L., Modeling supplier selection and the use of option contracts for global supply chain design (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36, pp. 2786-2800",English,Article

First, it introduces the notion of transfer equilibrium as a strategy combination for which individual stability can be supported by allowing the possibility of transfers of the induced payoffs. Clearly, Nash equilibria are transfer equilibria, but under common regularity conditions the reverse is also true. This result typically does not hold for finite games without the possibility of randomisation, and transfer equilibria for this particular class are studied in some detail. The second part of the paper introduces, also within the setting of finite games, contracting on monetary transfers as an explicit strategic option, resulting in an associated two-stage contract game. In the first stage of the contract game, each player has the option of proposing transfer schemes for an arbitrary collection of outcomes. Only if the players fully agree on the entire set of transfer proposals, the payoffs of the game to be played in the second stage are modified accordingly. The main results provide explicit characterisations of the sets of payoff vectors that are supported by Nash equilibrium and virtual subgame perfect equilibrium, respectively. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Contract game; Folk theorems; Monetary transfer scheme; Nash equilibrium; Transfer equilibrium; Virtual subgame perfect equilibrium,,"García-Jurado, I., González-Díaz, J., The role of commitment in finitely repeated games (2006) Optimization, 55, pp. 541-553; Jackson, M., Wilkie, S., Endogenous games and mechanisms: side payments among players (2005) Rev Econ Stud, 72, pp. 543-566; Kreps, D., Wilson, R., Sequential equilibria (1982) Econometrica, 50, pp. 863-894; Selten, R., Spieltheoretische behandlung eines oligopolmodells mit nachfrageträgheit (1965) Z Gesamte Staatswiss, 12, pp. 301-324; Yamada, A., Efficient equilibrium side contracts (2003) Econ Bull, 3, pp. 1-7",English,Article

Most of these optimization problems fall into the class of NP-hard problems, motivating the search for heuristic and approximated algorithms. Currently, a great interest is being devoted to those optimization approaches yielding a concrete integration with spatial analysis instruments (such as Geographical Information Systems) that provide the user with an easy visualization of input data and optimization results. Agent-Based computing was recently proposed as an alternative to mathematical programming in order to solve problems whose domains are concurrently distributed, complex, and heterogeneous, also thanks to the availability of many commercial and open source codes including graphical interfaces for the elements of the problem. In this paper we propose a general Agent-Based framework for modeling various location problems.

In the case of a conditionally permissible delay, if the retailer orders more than a predetermined quantity, then he/she has a grace period to make the full payment. Otherwise, he/she must pay the payment for goods of certain proportion first while receiving the goods and has a grace period to pay off the rest. As to a cash discount, if the retailer pays for the entire amount of the order within a certain short period, then he/she will receive a cash discount from the supplier. In additions, from a financial standpoint, all cash outflows related to the inventory control that occur at different points of time have different values. Hence, it is necessary to take account of the factor of time value of monetary when drafting the replenishment policy. In a word, this paper uses an alternate approach-discount cash flow (DCF) analysis to establish an inventory problem for deteriorating items in which the supplier provides the retailer either a conditionally permissible delay or a cash discount. We then study the necessary and sufficient conditions for finding the optimal solution.

This paper presents a new approach to the puzzle-assembly problem that is based on using textural features and geometrical constraints. The texture of a band outside the border of pieces is predicted by inpainting and texture synthesis methods. Feature values are derived from these original and predicted images of pieces. An affinity measure of corresponding pieces is defined and alignment of the puzzle pieces is formulated as an optimization problem where the optimum assembly of the pieces is achieved by maximizing the total affinity measure. A Fast Fourier Transform based image registration technique is used to speed up the alignment of the pieces.

Its utility relies on its ease of interpretation, especially by graphical means. The crucial factor which determines the performance of kernel density estimation is the bandwidth matrix selection. Research in finding optimal bandwidth matrices began with restricted parameterizations of the bandwidth matrix which mimic univariate selectors. Progressively these restrictions were relaxed to develop more flexible selectors. In this paper, we propose the first plug-in bandwidth selector with the unconstrained parameterizations of both the final and pilot selectors. Up till now, the development of unconstrained pilot selectors was hindered by the traditional vectorization of higher-order derivatives which lead to increasingly intractable matrix algebraic expressions. We resolve this by introducing an alternative vectorization which gives elegant and tractable expressions. This allows us to quantify the asymptotic and finite sample properties of unconstrained pilot selectors. For target densities with intricate structure (such as multimodality), our unconstrained selectors show the most improvement over the existing plug-in selectors. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic MISE; Multivariate kernel density estimation; Plug-in method; Pre-sphering; Unconstrained bandwidth selectors,,"Bowman, A.W., An alternative method of cross-validation for the smoothing of density estimates (1984) Biometrika, 71, pp. 353-360; Chacón, J.E., Data-driven choice of the smoothing parametrization for kernel density estimators (2009) Can J Stat, 37, pp. 249-265; Duong, T., Hazelton, M.L., Plug-in bandwidth matrices for bivariate kernel density estimation (2003) J Nonparametr Stat, 15, pp. 17-30; Duong, T., Hazelton, M.L., Convergence rates for unconstrained bandwidth matrix selectors in multivariate kernel density estimation (2005) J Multivar Anal, 93, pp. 417-433; Duong, T., Hazelton, M.L., Cross-validation bandwidth matrices for multivariate kernel density estimation (2005) Scand J Stat, 32, pp. 485-506; Hall, P., Marron, J.S., Estimation of integrated squared density derivatives (1987) Stat Probab Lett, 6, pp. 109-115; Hall, P., Marron, J.S., Park, B.U., Smoothed cross-validation (1992) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 92, pp. 1-20; Henderson, H.V., Searle, S.R., Vec and vech operators for matrices, with some uses in Jacobians and multivariate statistics (1979) Can J Stat, 7, pp. 65-81; Holmquist, B., The direct product permuting matrices (1985) Linear Multilinear Algebra, 17, pp. 117-141; Holmquist, B., The d-variate vector Hermite polynomial of order k (1996) Linear Algebra Appl, 237-238, pp. 155-190; Holmquist, B., Expectations of products of quadratic forms in normal variables (1996) Stoch Anal Appl, 14, pp. 149-164; Jones, M.C., Sheather, S.J., Using nonstochastic terms to advantage in kernel-based estimation of integrated squared density derivatives (1991) Stat Probab Lett, 11, pp. 511-514; Magnus, J.R., Neudecker, H., The elimination matrix: Some lemmas and applications (1980) SIAM J Algebra Discrete Methods, 1, pp. 422-449; Magnus, J.R., Neudecker, H., (1999) Matrix Differential Calculus with Applications in Statistics and Econometrics, , Chichester: Wiley; Meijer, E., Matrix algebra for higher order moments (2005) Linear Algebra Appl, 410, pp. 112-134; Park, B.U., Marron, J.S., Comparison of data-driven bandwidth selectors (1990) J Am Stat Assoc, 85, pp. 66-72; Rosenblatt, M., Remarks on some nonparametric estimates of a density function (1956) Ann Math Stat, 27, pp. 832-837; Rudemo, M., Empirical choice of histograms and kernel density estimators (1982) Scand J Stat, 9, pp. 65-78; Sain, S.R., Baggerly, K.A., Scott, D.W., Cross-validation of multivariate densities (1994) J Am Stat Assoc, 89, pp. 807-817; Schott, J.R., Kronecker product permutation matrices and their application to moment matrices of the normal distribution (2003) J Multivar Anal, 87, pp. 177-190; Schott, J.R., (2005) Matrix Analysis for Statics, , 2nd edn., New York: Wiley; Scott, D.W., Terrell, G.R., Biased and unbiased cross-validation in density estimation (1987) J Am Stat Assoc, 82, pp. 1131-1146; Sheather, S.J., Jones, M.C., A reliable data-based bandwidth selection method for kernel density estimation (1991) J R Stat Soc Ser B Stat Methodol, 53, pp. 683-690; Silverman, B.W., (1986) Density Estimation for Statics and Data Analysis, , London: Chapman & Hall; Simonoff, J.S., (1996) Smoothing Methods in Statics, , Berlin: Springer; Wand, M.P., Error analysis for general multivariate kernel estimators (1992) J Nonparametr Stat, 2, pp. 2-15; Wand, M.P., Jones, M.C., Comparison of smoothing parameterizations in bivariate kernel density estimation (1993) J Am Stat Assoc, 88, pp. 520-528; Wand, M.P., Jones, M.C., Multivariate plug-in bandwidth selection (1994) Comput Stat, 9, pp. 97-117; Wand, M.P., Jones, M.C., (1995) Kernel Smoothing, , London: Chapman & Hall",English,Article
Miura H.,A study of travel time prediction using universal kriging,2010,TOP,257,270,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956947329&partnerID=40&md5=1babc3326ba1aaa0d5094fee6d25a92e,"This study describes an approach for predicting travel time by kriging. The kriging method, which is a means of spatial prediction, is used as prediction measure for car travel time in an imaginary four-dimensional space. Each point in the space represents a single journey: the coordinates of a point are the coordinates of the origin and destination on a plane. The travel time can then be viewed as a function over this four-dimensional space. The prediction relies on the feature that nearby points (in the four-dimensional space) will have almost the same travel time. In this approach, it is not necessary to break down travel times from origin to destination into link travel times. The approach will also allow us to use information from ""probe vehicles"" for travel time prediction in the near future. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in London and its environs. The case study uses 200 observations for verification. The multiple correlation coefficient of estimated travel time and the verification data is 0.9045. The results indicate that 95% prediction limits are between ±10 minutes and ±30 minutes for travel between two arbitrary points. This prediction method is effective for urban districts with links having changeable travel time owing to congestion. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Geostatistics; Road congestion; Travel time prediction; Universal kriging,,"http://www.theaa.com/route-planner/index.jsp, AA Route Planner, Accessed 2 Feb 2009Braxmeier, H., Schmidt, V., Spodarev, E., Kriged road-traffic maps (2005) Interfacing Geostatistics, GIS and Spatial Data Bases.

Indeed, MARS denotes a modern methodology from statistical learning which is important in both classification and regression, with an increasing number of applications in many areas of science, economy and technology. It is very useful for high-dimensional problems and shows a great promise for fitting nonlinear multivariate functions. The MARS algorithm for estimating the model function consists of two algorithms, these are the forward and the backward stepwise algorithm. In our paper, we propose not to use the backward stepwise algorithm. Instead, we construct a penalized residual sum of squares for MARS as a Tikhonov regularization problem which is also known as ridge regression. We treat this problem using continuous optimization techniques which we consider to become an important complementary technology and model-based alternative to the concept of the backward stepwise algorithm. In particular, we apply the elegant framework of conic quadratic programming. This is an area of convex optimization which is very well-structured, herewith, resembling linear programming and, hence, permitting the use of powerful interior point methods. Based on these theoretical and algorithmical studies, this paper also contains an application to diabetes data. We evaluate and compare the performance of the established MARS and our new CMARS in classifying diabetic persons, where CMARS turns out to be very competitive and promising. © 2010 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Classification; Clustering; Conic quadratic programming; Continuous optimization; Curvature; Interior point methods; MARS; Penalty methods; Regression; Statistical learning; Well-structured convex problems,,"Standards of medical care in diabetes.

A conventional optimization approach to location problems considers only the optimality of locational decisions for specific clients data. Real-world applications inevitably involve errors and uncertainties in the operating conditions, and thereby the resulting performance may be lower than expected. In particular, a distribution system design is very sensitive to the varying demands for goods, and the demand changes may deteriorate drastically the system efficiency when optimized for different demand structure. Several approaches have been developed to deal with uncertain or imprecise data. The approaches focused on the quality or on the variation (stability) of the solution for some data domains are considered robust. Frequently, uncertainty is represented by limits (intervals) on possible values of demand weights varying independently rather than by scenarios for all the weights simultaneously. In this paper we show that a solution concept of the conditional median can be used to optimize effectively such robust location problems. The conditional median is a generalization of the minimax solution concept extended to take into account the number of services (the portion of demand) related to the worst performances. Namely, for a specified portion of demand, we take into account the corresponding portion of the maximum results, and we consider their average as the worst conditional mean to be minimized. Similar to the standard minimax approach, the minimization of the worst conditional mean can be defined by a linear objective and a number of auxiliary linear inequalities. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Conditional median; Efficiency; Location; Multiple criteria; Robustness,,"Fernandez, F.R., Nickel, S., Puerto, J., Rodriguez-Chia, A.M., Robustness in the Pareto-solutions for the multi-criteria minisum location problem (2001) J Multi-Criteria Decis Anal, 10, pp. 191-203; Francis, R.L., McGinnis, L.F., White, J.A., (1992) Facility Layout and Location: An Analytical Approach, , Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall; Gupta, S., Rosenhead, J., Robustness in sequential investment decisions (1968) Manag Sci, 15, pp. 18-29; Hites, R., de Smet, Y., Risse, N., Salazar-Neumann, M., Vincke, P., About the applicability of MCDA to some robustness problems (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 174, pp. 322-332; Kostreva, M.M., Ogryczak, W., Equitable approaches to location problems (1999) Spatial Multicriteria Decision Making and Analysis: A Geographic Information Sciences Approach, pp. 103-126. , J.-C.

It is a multi-period discrete location problem in which each customer is serviced in exactly one period of the planning horizon. The locational decisions are made independently for each period, so that the facilities that are open need not be the same in different time periods. It is also assumed that at each period there is a minimum number of customers that can be assigned to the facilities that are open. The decisions to be made include not only the facilities to open at each time period and the time period in which each customer will be served, but also the allocation of customers to open facilities in their service period. We propose two alternative formulations that use different sets of decision variables. We prove that in the first formulation the coefficient matrix of the allocation subproblem that results when fixing the facilities to open at each time period is totally unimodular. On the other hand, we also show that the pricing problem of the second model can be solved by inspection. We prove that a Lagrangean relaxation of the first one yields the same lower bound as the LP relaxation of the second one. While the Lagrangean dual can be solved with a classical subgradient optimization algorithm, the LP relaxation requires the use of column generation, given the large number of variables of the second model. We compare the computational burden for obtaining this lower bound through both models. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Column generation; Discrete facility location; Lagrangean heuristic; Multi-period location,,"Albareda-Sambola, M., Fernández, E., Hinojosa, Y., Puerto, J., The multi-period incremental service facility location problem (2009) Comput Oper Res, 36 (5), pp. 1356-1375; Chardaire, P., Sutter, A., Costa, M.C., Solving the dynamic facility location problem (1996) Networks, 28, pp. 117-124; Cornuejols, G., Nemhauser, G.L., Wolsey, L.A., The uncapacitated facility location problem (1990) Discrete Location Theory, pp. 119-171. , P.

A known constant fraction of the demand during the stockout period is backlogged, and the rest are lost sales. Usually, in the literature on inventory control, the unit backorder cost is considered to be a linear function of the waiting time until the customer gets the item. However, in some real-world situations, the unit cost of a backorder may not be linear. To model this situation, we develop a new approach by considering that the backlogging unit cost is a nondecreasing, continuous, and positive function of the amount of time the customers wait before receiving the item. Our objective is to maximize the average profit per unit time. An effective solution procedure to determine the optimal policy and the maximum average profit is developed. Numerical examples, which help us to understand the theoretical results, are also presented. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigacion Operativa 2009.",EOQ models; General backorder cost; Logistics; Partial backlogging,,"Abad, P.L., Optimal lot size for a perishable good under conditions of finite production and partial backordering and lost sale (2000) Comput Ind Eng, 38, pp. 457-465;

The novelty of our approach lies in the players' ability to form coalitions before the actual division of the good with the aim to maximize the average utility of the coalition. A social welfare function which takes into account coalitions drives the division. In addition, we derive a cooperative game which measures the performance of each coalition. This game is compared with the game in which players start cooperating only after the good has been portioned and has been allocated among the players. We show that a modified version of the game played before the division outperforms the game played after the division. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigacion Operativa 2008.",Cooperative games; Fair division; Maximin partition,,"Berliant, M., Equilibrium models with land: A criticism and an alternative (1985) Reg Sci Urban Econ, 15, pp. 325-340; Berliant, M., Dunz, K., A foundation of location theory: Existence of equilibrium, the welfare theorems, and core (2004) J Math Econ, 40, pp. 593-618; Berliant, M., Thomson, W., Dunz, K., On the fair division of a heterogeneous commodity (1992) J Math Econ, 21, pp. 201-216; Brams, S.J., (2008) Mathematics and Democracy-Designing Better Voting and Fair Division Procedures, , Princeton: Princeton University Press; Brams, S.J., Taylor, A.D., (1996) Fair Division: From Cake-Cutting to Dispute Resolution, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Dubins, L., Spanier, H., How to cut a cake fairly (1961) Am Math Mon, 68 (1), pp. 1-17; Hill, T.P., Partitioning inequalities in probability and statistics (1993) Stochastic Inequalities, 22, pp. 116-132. , IMS lecture notes, Hayward: IMS; Legut, J., On totally balanced games arising from cooperation in fair division (1990) Games Econ Behav, 2, pp. 47-60; Legut, J., Potters, J.A.M., Tijs, S., Economies with land-A game theoretical approach (1994) Games Econ Behav, 6, pp. 416-430; Legut, J., Potters, J.A.M., Tijs, S., A transfer property of equilibrium payoffs in economies with land (1995) Games Econ Behav, 10, pp. 355-367; Lyapunov, A., Sur les fonctions-vecteurs complétement additives (1940) Bull Acad Sci USSR, 4, pp. 465-478; Sprumont, Y., Population monotonic allocation schemes for cooperative games with transferable utility (1990) Games Econ Behav, 2, pp. 378-394; Tadenuma, K., Thomson, W., Games of fair division (1995) Games Econ Behav, 9, pp. 191-204",English,Article

These situations involve the construction of a spanning tree with the minimum cost as well as the allocation of the cost of this minimum cost spanning tree among its users in a fair way. Feltkamp, Muto and Tijs 1994 introduced the equal remaining obligations rule to solve the cost allocation problem in these situations. Recently, it has been shown that the equal remaining obligations rule satisfies many appealing properties and can be obtained with different approaches. In this paper, we provide a new approach to obtain the equal remaining obligations rule. Specifically, we show that the equal remaining obligations rule can be obtained as the average of the cost allocations provided by a vertex oriented construct-and-charge procedure for each order of players. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigacion Operativa 2009.",Cost allocation; Minimum cost spanning tree situations,,"Bergantiños, G., Vidal-Puga, J.J., (2005) Several Approaches to the Same Rule in Cost Spanning Tree Problems, , Mimeo; Bergantiños, G., Vidal-Puga, J.J., (2005) Additivity in Cost Spanning Tree Problems, , RGEA WP 10-05, University of Vigo, Spain; Bergantiños, G., Vidal-Puga, J.J., The optimistic TU game in minimum cost spanning tree problems (2007) Int J Game Theory, 36, pp. 223-239; Bergantiños, G., Vidal-Puga, J.J., A fair rule in minimum cost spanning tree problems (2007) J Econ Theory, 137, pp. 326-352; Bird, C.G., On cost allocation for a spanning tree: A game theoretic approach (1976) Networks, 6, pp. 335-350; Branzei, R., Moretti, S., Norde, H., Tijs, S., The P-value for cost sharing in minimum cost spanning tree situations (2004) Theory Decis, 56, pp. 47-61; Dutta, B., Kar, A., Cost monotonicity, consistency and minimum cost spanning tree games (2004) Games Econ Behav, 48, pp. 223-248; Feltkamp, V., Muto, S., Tijs, S., (1994) On the Irreducible Core and the Equal Remaining Obligations Rule of Minimum Cost Spanning Extension Problems, , CentER-DP 106, Tilburg University, Center for Economic Research, The Netherlands; Gondran, M., Minoux, M., (1984) Graphs and Algorithms, , New York: Wiley; Granot, D., Huberman, G., Minimum cost spanning tree games (1981) Math Program, 21, pp. 1-18; Granot, D., Huberman, G., On the core and nucleolus of the minimum cost spanning tree games (1984) Math Program, 29, pp. 323-347; Kar, A., Axiomatization of the Shapley value on minimum cost spanning tree games (2002) Games Econ Behav, 38, pp. 265-277; Kruskal Jr., J.B., On the shortest spanning subtree of a graph and the traveling salesman problem (1956) Proc Am Math Soc, 7, pp. 48-50; Moretti, S., Branzei, R., Norde, H., Tijs, S., (2005) Cost Monotonic Construct and Charge Rules for Connection Situations, , CentER-DP 104, Tilburg University, Center for Economic Research, The Netherlands; Norde, H., Moretti, S., Tijs, S., Minimum cost spanning tree games and population monotonic allocation schemes (2004) Eur J Oper Res, 154, pp. 84-97; Prim, R.C., Shortest connection networks and some generalizations (1957) Bell Syst Tech J, 36, pp. 1389-1401; Tijs, S., Branzei, R., Moretti, S., Norde, H., Obligation rules for minimum cost spanning tree situations and their monotonicity properties (2006) Eur J Oper Res, 175, pp. 121-134",English,Article

A two-stage approach is proposed for solving this problem. In the first stage, an integer model is solved for selecting the stations to be constructed and the links between them. It drastically reduces the dimension of a modification of a 0-1 model given in the literature to adapt it to our problem. In the second stage, the line design problem is solved by means of a procedure that assigns each selected link to exactly one line under certain constraints. We report some computational experiments that show that our approach also produces a drastic reduction on the computational effort required for solving the modification of the 0-1 model given in the literature. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa., 2008.",Circular line; Degree of a node; Line designing; Station and link location,,"Bruno, G., Gendreau, M., Laporte, G., A heuristic for the location of a rapid transit line (2002) Comput Oper Res, 29, pp. 1-12; Bruno, G., Ghiani, G., Improta, G., A multi-modal approach to the location of a rapid transit line (1998) Eur J Oper Res, 104, pp. 321-332; Escudero, L.F., Muñoz, S., Improvements on the extended rapid transit network design problem modelling (2008), Technical Reports on Statistics and Decision Sciences, TR08/01, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, SpainGendreau, M., Laporte, G., Mesa, J.A., Locating rapid transit lines (1995) J Adv Transp, 29, pp. 145-162; Hamacher, H.W., Liebers, A., Schöbel, A., Wagner, D., Wagner, F., Locating new stops in a railway network (2001) Electron Notes Theor Comput Sci, 50, pp. 1-11; Laporte, G., Marín, Á., Mesa, J.A., Ortega, F.A., An integrated methodology for the rapid transit network design problem (2007) Algorithmic Methods for Railway Optimization, 4359, pp. 187-199. , Lect notes comput sci, F.

He is the renowned author of the Mishneh Torah, a comprehensive code of Jewish law. Book 12 (""Book of Acquisition""), Treatise 4 (""Agents and Partners""), of the Code of Maimonides is devoted in Chapter 4 to the allocation of the surplus from funds which a partnership invests in an indivisible input. The Rabbi's case translates into a cooperative game where all intermediate coalitions are inessential. Standard axioms for cooperative-game solutions then suggest that the surplus be shared equally by the players, which is precisely the Maimonidean ruling. We show that this outcome can be preserved in spirit under much weaker assumptions on the worth of a game's intermediate coalitions.

Other facilities offering the same product or service already exist in the area. Both the locations and the qualities of the new facilities are to be found so as to maximize the profit obtained by the firm. This is a global optimization problem, with many parameters to be estimated, and whose behavior is not really well understood. Using random problems and a robust evolutionary algorithm recently proposed for solving this problem, the behavior of optimal solutions in various environments and changes in the basic model parameters are researched. These comprise the quality of existing and new facilities, cost function and presence of the chain.

In Bala and Goyal (Econometrica 68, 1181-1229, 2000), the one-sided link formation model has been considered, which is based on a noncooperative game of network formation. They found that the empty networks, the wheel in the one-way flow of benefits case and the center-sponsored star in the two-way flow case play a fundamental role since they are strict Nash equilibria of the corresponding games for a certain class of payoff functions. In this paper, we first prove that all these network structures are in weakly dominated strategies whenever there are no strict Nash equilibria. Then, we exhibit a more accurate selection device between these network architectures by considering ""altruistic behavior"" refinements. Such refinements that we investigate here in the framework of finite strategy sets games have been introduced by the authors in previous papers. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Altruistic behavior; Equilibrium refinements; Network formation,,"Bala, V., Goyal, S., A noncooperative model of network formation (2000) Econometrica, 68, pp. 1181-1229; Bernheim, B.D., Peleg, B., Whinston, M.D., Coalition-proof Nash equilibria I.

Examples of StopLoc include the location of bus stops along some given bus routes or of railway stations along the tracks in a railway system. In order to evaluate the decision assume that potential customers in given demand facilities are known. Two objectives are proposed. In the first one, we minimize the number of stations such that any of the demand facilities can reach a closest station within a given distance of r. In the second objective, we fix the number of new stations and minimize the sum of the distances between demand facilities and stations. The resulting two problems CovStopLoc and AccessStopLoc are solved by a reduction to a classical set covering and a restricted location problem, respectively.

We solve this optimal control problem using an approach based on the Euler-Lagrange necessary condition in integral form in which time is discretized and admissible variations for each variable are approximated using a linear combination of piecewise-continuous basis functions of time. Our method consists in a numerical resolution of an unconstrained reformulation of the optimal control problem in which the dynamic equation is regarded as a constraint. Then, we use a damped Newton methodology to solve the resulting nonlinear system of difference equations. The required initial guess of the solution is obtained using a trigonometric polynomial interpolation. The use of the Euler-Lagrange necessary condition in integral form avoids the numerical intricacy caused by the presence of corner of the extremals. In this way a general method for the solution of optimal control problems is obtained in which constraints on the state can be easily introduced. The accuracy of the proposed procedure is assessed by comparing the obtained global error with different discretization sizes. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been compared with a direct transcription method, a widely used procedure to solve optimal control problems. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigacion Operativa 2009.",Optimal control; Robotics; Variational calculus,,"Ailon, A., Langholz, G., On the existence of time-optimal control of mechanical manipulators (1985) J Optim Theory Appl, 46 (1), pp. 1-23; Bessonnet, G., Sardain, P., Chessé, S., Optimal motion synthesis-dynamic modelling and numerical solving aspects (2002) Multibody Syst Dyn, 8, pp. 257-278; Bessonnet, G., Chessé, S., Sardain, P., Optimal gait synthesis of a seven-link planar biped (2004) Int J Robot Res, 23 (1011), pp. 1059-1073; Betts, J.T., Survey of numerical methods for trajectory optimization (1998) J Guid Control Dyn, 21 (2), pp. 193-207; Betts, J.T., (2001) Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming, , Philadelphia: SIAM; Betts, J.T., Cramer, E.J., Application of direct transcription to commercial aircraft trajectory optimization (1995) J Guid Control Dyn, 18 (1); Bryson, A.E., Ho, Y.C., (1975) Applied Optimal Control, , Washington: Hemisphere; Chen, Y., On the structure of the minimum-time control law for multiple robot arms handling a common object (1991) IEEE Trans Autom Control, 36 (2), pp. 230-233; Chen, Y., Existence and structure of minimum-time control for multiple robot arms handling a common object (1991) Int J Control, 53, pp. 855-869; Choset, H., Lynch, K.M., Hutchinson, S., Kantor, G., Burgard, W., Kavraki, L.E., Thrun, S., (2005) Principles of Robot Motion: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations, , Cambridge: MIT Press; Enright, P.J., Conway, B.A., Discrete approximations to optimal trajectories using direct transcription and nonlinear programming (1992) J Guid Control Dyn, 15 (4), pp. 994-1002; Geering, H.P., Guzzella, L., Hepner, S.A., Onder, C.H., Time-optimal motions of robots in assembly tasks (1986) IEEE Trans Automat Control, AC-31 (6), pp. 512-518; Gregory, J., Hughes, H., Efficient constrained optimization: From the deterministic past to the stochastic future (2005) Nonlinear Anal, 63, pp. 763-774; Gregory, J., Hughes, H., New efficient numerical procedures for solving stochastic variational problems with a priori maximum pointwise error estimates (2007) J Math Anal Appl, 328, pp. 1378-1395; Gregory, J., Hughes, H., A new theory and the efficient methods of solution of strong, pathwise, stochastic variational problems (2009) Methods Appl Anal, 11 (3), pp. 303-316; Gregory, J., Lin, C., (1996) Constrained Optimization in the Calculus of Variations and Optimal Control Theory, , London: Chapman & Hall; Gregory, J., Wang, R.S., Discrete variable methods for the m-dependent variable, nonlinear external problem in the calculus of variations (1990) SIAM J Numer Anal, 27 (2), pp. 470-487; Halperin, D., Kavraki, L., Latombe, J., Robot algorithms (1999) Algorithms and Theory of Computation Handbook, , M.

To solve the timetabling problem, we propose a three-stage approach combining several optimization criteria. Initially and mainly, the maximum relative travel time (ratio of travel time to minimum possible travel time) is minimized subject to a set of constraints, including departure time, train speed, minimum and maximum dwell time, and headway at track segments and stations. Since this problem has many solutions, the process is repeated for other trains, keeping the relative travel times of the critical train fixed, until all trains have been assigned their optimal relative travel times. In the second stage, the prompt allocation of trains is a secondary objective, and finally, in the third stage, the one minimizing the sum of the station dwell times of all trains, keeping the relative travel times constant, is selected to reduce fuel consumption, as a tertiary objective. To consider the user preferences in the optimization problems, the user preference departure time is used instead of the actual planned departure times. In order to guarantee that the exact or a very good approximate global optimum is attained, an algorithm based on the bisection rule is used. This method allows the computation time to be reduced in at least one order of magnitude for 42 trains. The problem of sensitivity analysis is also discussed, and closed form formulas for the sensitivities in terms of the dual variables are given. Several examples of applications are presented to illustrate the goodness of the proposed method. The results show that an adequate selection of intermediate stations and of the departure times are crucial in the good performance of the line and that inadequate spacings between consecutive trains can block the line. In addition, it is shown that, in order to improve performance, regional trains must be scheduled just ahead of or following the long distance trains, rather than having independent schedules. The sensitivities are shown to be very useful in identifying critical trains, segments, stations, departure times, and headways and in suggesting line infrastructure changes. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2008.",Bisection method; Global optimum; Railways; Sensitivity analysis; Single track; Train timetabling,,"Adenso-Diaz, B., González, M.O., González-torre, P., On-line timetable re-scheduling in regional train services (1999) Transp Res Part B, 33 (6), pp. 387-398; Amit, I., Goldfarb, D., The timetable problem for railways (1971) Dev Oper Res, 2, pp. 379-387; Assad, A., Models for rail transportation (1980) Transp Res Part A, 14 (3), pp. 205-220; Brannlund, U., Lindberg, P.O., Nou, A., Nilsson, J.E., Railway timetabling using Lagrangian relaxation (1998) Transp Sci, 32 (4), pp. 358-369; Cai, X., Goh, C.J., Mees, A.I., Greedy heuristics for rapid scheduling of trains on a single track (1998) IIE Trans, 30 (5), pp. 481-493; Caprara, A., Fischetti, M., Toth, P., Modeling and solving the train timetabling problem (2002) Oper Res, 50 (5), pp. 851-861; Caprara, A., Kroon, L., Monaci, M., Peeters, M., Toth, P., Passenger railway optimization (2006) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 14, pp. 129-187. , Barnhart, C, Laporte, G (eds); Carey, M., A model and strategy for train pathing with choice of lines, platforms and routes (1994) Transp Res Part B, 28 (5), pp. 333-353; Carey, M., Extending a train pathing model from one-way to two-way track (1994) Transp Res Part B, 28 (5), pp. 395-400; Carey, M., Lockwood, D., A model, algorithms and strategy for train pathing (1995) J Oper Res Soc, 46 (8), pp. 988-1005; Castillo, E., Cobo, A., Jubete, F., Pruneda, R.E., Castillo, C., An orthogonally based pivoting transformation of matrices and some applications (2000) SIAM J Matrix Anal Appl, 22, pp. 666-681; Castillo, E., Conejo, A., Pedregal, P., García, R., Alguacil, N., (2001) Building and Solving Mathematical Programming Models in Engineering and Science.

Both families contain the wrapped normal and wrapped Laplace and generalized Laplace distributions as special cases. Stochastic models for the genesis of these new distributions, which may be useful in identifying situations in which they are likely to occur, are developed.

Then, we characterize the maxisets associated to kernel estimators and to the Lepski procedure for the rate of convergence (log n/n)β/(2β+d) in terms of Besov and Hölder spaces of regularity β.

More precisely, zt is called the return level associated with a given return period t if the level zt is expected to be exceeded on average once every t years. To estimate this level in the independent and identically distributed setting, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has been classically used by assuming that exceedances above a high threshold approximately follow a Generalized Pareto distribution (GPD). This approximation is based on an asymptotic argument, but the rate of convergence may be slow in some cases, e.g., Gaussian variables, and the choice of an appropriate threshold difficult. As an alternative, we propose and study simple estimators of lower and upper return level bounds. This approach has several advantages. It works for both small and moderate sample sizes and for discrete and continuous random variables. In addition, no threshold selection procedure is needed. Still, there is a clear link with EVT because our bounds can be viewed as extensions of the concept of the probability weighted moments that has been classically used in hydrology. In particular, some moment conditions have to be satisfied in order to derive the asymptotic properties of our estimators. We apply our methodology to a few simulations and two climate data sets. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2008.",Discrete extremes; Empirical processes; Generalized Pareto distribution; Return level,,"Bonnin, G., Todd, D., Lin, B., Parzybok, T., Yekta, M., Riley, D., (2004) NOAA Atlas 14, Precipitation Frequency Atlas of the United States, 1-2. , US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, Silver Spring, Maryland; Coles, S.G., (2001) An Introduction to Statistical Modeling of Extreme Values, , Springer Series in Statistics, Berlin: Springer; Coles, S., Dixon, M., Likelihood-based inference for extreme value models (1999) Extremes, 2, pp. 5-23; Cooley, D., Nychka, D.M., Naveau, P., (2005) Bayesian Spatial Modeling of Extreme Precipitation Return Levels, , (In review); Csörgo, M., Csörgo, S., Horváth, L., Mason, D.M., Weighted empirical and quantile process (1986) Ann Probab, 14, pp. 31-85; Csörgo, M., Csörgo, S., Horváth, L., Mason, D.M., Normal and stable convergence of integral functions of the empirical distribution function (1986) Ann Probab, 14, pp. 86-118; Diebolt, J., Guillou, A., Rached, I., A new look at probability-weighted moments estimators (2004) C R Acad Sci de Paris, 7, pp. 629-634; Diebolt, J., Guillou, A., Rached, I., Approximation of the distribution of excesses through a generalized probability weighted moment method (2007) J Stat Plan Inference, 137, pp. 841-857; Einmahl, J.H.J., Mason, D.M., Laws of the iterated logarithm in the tails for weighted uniform empirical processes (1988) Ann Probab, 16, pp. 126-141; Einmahl, J.H.J., Mason, D.M., Strong limit theorems for weighted quantile processes (1988) Ann Probab, 16, pp. 1623-1643; Einmahl, U., Mason, D.M., Approximation to permutation and exchangeable processes (1992) J Theor Probab, 5, pp. 101-126; Embrechts, P., Klüppelberg, C., Mikosch, T., (1997) Modelling Extremal Events for Insurance and Finance, , Berlin: Springer; Helmers, R., Janssen, P., Serfling, R., Berry-Esséen and Bootstrap results for generalized L-statistics (1990) Scand J Statist, 17, pp. 65-77; Hoskings, J., Wallis, J., Parameter and quantile estimation for the generalized Pareto distribution (1987) Technometrics, 29, pp. 339-349; Hoskings, J., Wallis, J., Wood, E., Estimation of the generalized extreme-value distribution by the method of probability-weighted-moments (1985) Technometrics, 27, pp. 251-261; Katz, R., Parlange, M., Naveau, P., Extremes in hydrology (2002) Adv Water Resour, 25, pp. 1287-1304; Landwher, J., Matalas, N., Wallis, J., Probability weighted moments compared with some traditional techniques in estimating Gumbel parameters and quantiles (1979) Water Resour Res, 15, pp. 1055-1064; Leadbetter, M.R., Lindgren, G., Rootzén, H., (1983) Extremes and Related Properties of Random Sequences and Processes, , New York: Springer; Li, D., Rao, M.B., Tomkins, R.J., The law of the iterated logarithm and central limit theorem for L-statistics (2001) J Multivar Anal, 78 (2), pp. 191-217; Philips, T.K., Nelson, R., The moment bound is tighter than Chernoff's bound for positive tail (1995) Am Stat, 49, pp. 175-179; Rached, I., (2004) Moments Pondérés Généralisés, , PhD thesis, Université de Marne-la-Vallée, France; Resnick, S., (1987) Extreme Values, Regular Variation, and Point Processes, , New York: Springer; Shorack, G.R., Wellner, J.A., (1986) Empirical Processes with Applications to Statistics, , New York: Wiley; Wang, Q., Jing, B.-Y., Zhao, L., The Berry-Esséen bound for studentized statistics (2000) Ann Probab, 28 (1), pp. 511-535; Wellner, J.A., Limit theorems for the ratio of the empirical distribution function to the true distribution function (1978) Z Wahrsch Verw Geb, 45, pp. 73-88",English,Article

In the paper, we demonstrate that for the process with non-stationary immigration it may have a normal limit distribution. Considering a discrete time branching process Z(n) with time-dependent immigration, whose mean and variance vary regularly with nonnegative exponents α and β, respectively, we show that 1 + 2α is the threshold for asymptotic normality of the estimator. It will be proved that if β < 1 + 2α, the estimator is asymptotically normal with two different normalizing factors, and if β > 1 + 2α its limiting distribution is not normal, but can be expressed in terms of certain functionals of the time-changed Wiener process. When β = 1 + 2α, the limiting distribution depends on the behavior of the slowly varying parts of the mean and variance. We derive all possible limit distributions of the weighted CLSE based on observations {Z(r+1),Z(r+2),...,Z(n)} as n → ∞ and r=[nε], 0≤ ε < 1.

Our setup is given by triangular arrays of independent identically distributed random variables and different normalizations related to the rates of bootstrap intensities. We show that the behavior of this low intensity bootstrap coincides with that of partial sums of a number of summands equal to the bootstrap resampling size. Agreement on the limit laws for different (small) bootstrap sizes is thus shown to be closely related to domains of attraction of α-stable laws.

However, when aggregating small areas within the same region, the sum of these small area estimates does not generally match up with the estimate obtained using an appropriate estimator for the larger region. Then, benchmarking the model-dependent estimates to the ones obtained at certain level of aggregation is needed. In this paper, we propose a small area estimator based on a linear mixed effects model with restrictions to guarantee the concordance between the aggregations of small area estimates and those reported by statistical agencies for larger domains using a synthetic estimator. The mean squared prediction error of the restricted estimator is also derived and its performance is evaluated through a simulation study.

The semi-parametric estimation of high quantiles depends not only on the estimation of the tail index or extreme value index γ, the primary parameter of extreme events, but also on the adequate estimation of a scale first order parameter. Recently, apart from new classes of reduced-bias estimators for γ>0, new classes of the scale first order parameter have been introduced in the literature. Their use in quantile estimation enables us to introduce new classes of asymptotically unbiased high quantiles' estimators, with the same asymptotic variance as the (biased) ""classical"" estimator. The asymptotic distributional properties of the proposed classes of estimators are derived and the estimators are compared with alternative ones, not only asymptotically, but also for finite samples through Monte Carlo techniques.

When obtaining the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of θ in the presence of λ requires intensive computation, the pseudo MLE of θ, based on a pseudo likelihood function, can be used. Gong and Samaniego (Ann. Stat. 9:861-869, 1981) proposed a pseudo MLE (PMLE) based on simple random samples. Ranked set sampling has been applied to the bivariate variables (X,Y) where measuring one of the variables is difficult or costly. In this paper, we obtain the pseudo MLE of the correlation coefficient from a bivariate normal distribution (X,Y) based on ranked set samples, assuming that Y is difficult or more expensive to measure and that the mean and variance of Y are the nuisance parameters. The PMLE is compared with three other estimators of the correlation coefficient. Simulations show that the PMLE is more (less) efficient than other estimators, depending on value of ρ. Testing of soil contamination provides an example of the use of the methods. © 2008 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bivariate normal distribution; Concomitant variable; Pseudo maximum likelihood estimator; Ranked set sampling,,"Barnett, V., Green, P.J., Robinson, A., Concomitants and correlation estimates (1976) Biometrika, 63, pp. 323-329; Chen, Z., Bai, Z., Sinha, B.K., (2004) Ranked set sampling: Theory and applications, , Springer, New York; Dell, J.R., Clutter, J.L., Ranked set sampling theory with order statistics background (1972) Biometrics, 28, pp. 545-553; Gilbert, R.O., Shinn, J.H., Essington, E.H., Romney, E.M., Moor, K.S., O'Farrell, T.P., Radionuclide transport from soil to air, native vegetation, kangaroo rats and grazing cattle on the Nevada test site (1988) Health Phys, 35, pp. 869-887; Hui, T.P., (2005) Bootstrap and likelihood based inference for ranked set samples, , Unpublished PhD dissertation, Department of Statistics, The George Washington University, Washington DC; Hui, T.P., Modarres, R., Zheng, G., Bootstrap confidence interval estimation of die regression mean with ranked set sampling (2005) J Stat Comput Simul, 75, pp. 543-553; Gong, G., Samaniego, F.J., Pseudo maximum likelihood estimation: Theory and application (1981) Ann Stat, 9, pp. 861-869; Johnson, N., Kotz, S., (1972) Continuous multivariate distributions, , Wiley, New York; McIntyre, G.A., A method of unbiased selective sampling using ranked sets (1952) Aust J Agric Res, 3, pp. 385-390; Parke, W.R., Pseudo maximum likelihood estimation: The asymptotic distribution (1986) Ann Stat, 14, pp. 355-357; Paul, G.P., Editorial: Ranked set sampling (1995) Environ Ecol Stat, 2, pp. 271-285; Sinha, A.K., On some recent developments in ranked set sampling (2005) Bull Inform Cybern, 37, pp. 137-160; Stokes, S.L., Inferences on the correlation coefficient in bivariate normal populations from, ranked set samples (1980) J Am Stat Assoc, 75, pp. 989-995; Yu, P.L.H., Lam, K., Regression estimator in ranked set sampling (1997) Biometrics, 53, pp. 1070-1080; Zheng, G., Modarres, R., A robust estimate of the correlation coefficient for bivariate normal distribution using ranked set sampling (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 298-309",English,Article

Monte-Carlo experiments complete the study and illustrate the method. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.,Adaptive estimation; Biased data; Minimax rate; Nonparametric penalized contrast estimator; Right-censoring,,"Antoniadis, A., Grégoire, G., Nason, G., Density and hazard rate estimation for right-censored data by using wavelet methods (1999) JR Stat Soc ser B Stat Methodol, 61, pp. 63-84; Asgharian, M., M'Lan, C.E., Wolfson, D.B., Length-biased sampling with right censoring: An unconditional approach (2002) J Am Stat Assoc, 97, pp. 201-209; Barron, A.R., Birgé, L., Massart, P., Risk bounds for model selection via penalization (1999) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 113, pp. 301-413; Birgé, L., Massart, P., Minimum contrast estimators on sieves: Exponential bounds and rates of convergence (1998) Bernoulli, 4 (3), pp. 329-375; Birgé, L., Rozenholc, Y., How many bins must be put in a regular histogram (2006) ESAIM Probab Stat, 10, pp. 24-45; Brunel, E., Comte, F., Penalized contrast estimation of hazard rate with censored data (2005) Sankhyā, 67, pp. 441-475; Brunel, E., Comte, F., Guilloux, A., (2005) Nonparametric Density Estimation in Presence of Bias and Censoring, , http://www.math-info.univ-paris5.fr/map5/publis/titres05.html, Preprint MAP5 2005-13; Chakraborty, R., Rao, C.R., Sen, P.K., Rao, C.R., Selection biases of samples and their resolutions (2000) Handbook of Statistics, 18, pp. 675-712. , Elsevier Amsterdam; Cox, D.R., Johnson, Smith, (1969) New Development in Survey Sampling, , Wiley New York; De Uña-Álvarez, J., Product-limit estimation for length-biased censored data (2002) Test, 11, pp. 109-125; De Una-Álvarez, J., Nonparametric estimation under length-biased sampling and type i censoring: A moment based approach (2004) Ann Inst Stat Math, 56, pp. 667-681; De Una-Álvarez, J., Rodriguez-Casal, A., Comparing nonparametric estimators for length-biased data (2006) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 35, pp. 905-920; Devore, R.A., Lorentz, G.G., (1993) Constructive Approximation, , Springer Berlin; Donoho, D.L., Johnstone, I.M., Minimax estimation with wavelet shrinkage (1998) Ann Stat, 26, pp. 879-921; Efromovich, S., Distribution estimation for biased data (2004) J Stat Plan Inference, 124, pp. 1-43; Efromovich, S., Density estimation for biased data (2004) Ann Stat, 32 (3), pp. 1137-1161; El Barmi, H., Simonoff, J.S., Transformation-based density estimation for weighted distributions (2000) J Nonparametric Stat, 12, pp. 861-878; El Ghouch, A., Van Keilegom, I., (2006) Nonparametric Regression with Dependent Censored Data, , Discussion paper.

In our case, the contrast is a L 2 norm dependence measure, which constitutes an alternative to the usual criteria, based on mutual information. We propose a non parametric evaluation of the L 2 contrast, using a wavelet projection estimator. The mean square error of the procedure is bounded under Besov assumptions. Finally, we provide a set of simulations to show how the method performs in practice. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Besov spaces; ICA; Non parametric density estimation; Wavelets,,"Barbedor, P., (2005) On Line Resources for Independent Component Analysis by Wavelets., , http://proba.jussieu.fr/pageperso/barbedor; Barbedor, P., (2006) Independent Component Analysis and Estimation of A Quadratic Functional, , Technical report, LPMA Thesis Université Paris 7, PMA-1078; Barbedor, P., (2006) Independent Component Analysis by Wavelets, , http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00119428, Thesis, Université Paris 7; Bell, A.J., Sejnowski, T.J., A non linear information maximization algorithm that performs blind separation (1995) Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 7, pp. 467-474; Cardoso, J.F., High-order contrasts for independent component analysis (1999) Neural Comput, 11, pp. 157-192; Cichocki, A., Amari, S., Yang, H., A new algorithm for blind signal separation (1996) Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 8, pp. 757-763; Comon, P., Independent component analysis, a new concept (1994) Signal Processing, 36, pp. 287-314; Daubechies, I., (1992) Ten Lectures on Wavelets, , SIAM Philadelphia; Gretton, A., (2004) Measuring Statistical Dependence with Hilbert-Schmidt Norms, , Technical report, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, October 2004; Hyvarinen, A., Oja, E., A fast fixed-point algorithm for independent component analysis (1997) Neural Comput, 9, pp. 1483-1492; Jordan, M.I., Bach, F.R., Kernel independent component analysis (2002) J Mach Learn Res, 3, pp. 1-48; Meyer, Y., (1997) Ondelettes et Opérateurs, , Hermann Paris; Nikol'Skiǐ, (1975) Approximation of Functions of Several Variables and Imbedding Theorems, , Springer Berlin; Nguyen, T., Strang, G., (1996) Wavelets and Filter Banks, , Wellesley-Cambridge Press Wellesley; Pham, D.-T., Fast algorithms for mutual information based independent component analysis (2004) IEEE Trans Signal Process, 52, p. 10; Plumbley, M.D., Lie group methods for optimization with orthogonality constraints (2004) Lecture Notes Comput Sci, 3195, pp. 1245-1252; Roch, J., (1995) Le Modèle Factoriel des Cinq Grandes Dimensions de Personnalité: Les Big Five, , Technical report, AFPA, DO/DEM, March 1995; Rosenblatt, M., A quadratic measure of deviation of two-dimensional density estimates and a test for independence (1975) Ann Stat, 3, pp. 1-14; Serfling, R.J., (1980) Approximation Theorems of Mathematical Statistics, , Wiley New York; Smith, S.T., Edelman, A., Arias, T., (1998) The Geometry of Algorithms with Orthogonality Constraints, , SIAM Philadelphia; Smola, A., Gretton, A., Herbrich, R., (2003) The Kernel Mutual Information, , Technical report, Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, April 2003; Tsybakov, A., Samarov, A., Nonparametric independent component analysis (2004) Bernouilli, 10, pp. 565-582",English,Article

During the last three decades, a vast amount of work has been done in the area. This has led, on the one hand, to a rich taxonomy of missing-data concepts, issues, and methods and, on the other hand, to a variety of data-analytic tools. Elements of taxonomy include: missing data patterns, mechanisms, and modeling frameworks; inferential paradigms; and sensitivity analysis frameworks. These are described in detail. A variety of concrete modeling devices is presented. To make matters concrete, two case studies are considered. The first one concerns quality of life among breast cancer patients, while the second one examines data from the Muscatine children's obesity study. © 2009 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Expectation-maximization algorithm;

In this case, the uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUEs) of the mean life and the failure rate at a design stress are derived. It is shown that the UMVUEs have smaller mean squared errors than the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs). A numerical example is used to illustrate the superiority of UMVUEs to MLEs. The optimum test plans of the models are also discussed based on the variance of UMVUEs. Furthermore, we discuss the generalization of the optimal plan to more than two levels of stress. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Maximum likelihood estimator; Optimum test plan; Progressive type-II censoring; Step-stress accelerated life test; Uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator,,"Andrews, G.E., Askey, R., Roy, R., (2000) Special Functions, Vol 13, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge pp 26-27; Bagdonavičius, V.B., Léo, G., Nikulin, M., Parametric inference for step-stress models (2002) IEEE Trans Reliab, 51, pp. 27-31; Bai, D.S., Kim, M.S., Lee, S.H., Optimum simple step-stress accelerated life tests with censoring (1989) IEEE Trans Reliab, 38, pp. 529-532; Balakrishnan, N., Aggarwale, R., (2000) Progressive Censoring: Theory, Methods and Applications, , Birkhäuser Boston; Bhattacharyya, G.K., Soejoeti, Z., A tampered failure rate model for step-stress accelerated life test (1989) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 18, pp. 1627-1643; Dorp, J.R., Mazzuchi, T.A., A general Bayes exponential inference model for accelerated life testing (2004) J Stat Plan Inference, 119, pp. 55-74; Gouno, E., Sen, A., Balakrishnan, N., Optimal step-stress test under progressive Type-I censoring (2004) IEEE Trans Reliab, 53, pp. 388-393; Khamis, I., Higgins, J.J., Optimum 3-step step-stress tests (1996) IEEE Trans Reliab, 45, pp. 341-345; Khamis, I., Higgins, J.J., A new model for step-stress testing (1998) IEEE Trans Reliab, 47, pp. 131-134; Nelson, W., (1990) Accelerated Life Testing: Statistical Models, Test Plans, and Data Analysis, , Wiley New York; Tang, L.C., Sun, Y.S., Goh, T.N., Ong, H.L., Analysis of step-stress accelerated-life-test data: A new approach (1996) IEEE Trans Reliab, 45, pp. 69-74; Tang, L.C., Sun, Y.S., Goh, T.N., Ong, H.L., Planning accelerated life tests for censored two-parameter exponential distributions (1999) Nav Res Log, 46, pp. 169-186; Teng, S.L., Yeo, K.P., A least-squares approach to analyzing life-stress relationship in step-stress accelerated life tests (2002) IEEE Trans Reliab, 51, pp. 177-182; Wang, R.H., Fei, H.L., Uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimate of the Weibull distribution tampered failure rate (2003) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 32, pp. 2321-2338; Xu, H., Tang, Y., Commentary: The Khamis/Higgins model (2003) IEEE Trans Reliab, 52, pp. 4-6",English,Article
Escudero L.F.,On a mixture of the fix-and-relax coordination and Lagrangian substitution schemes for multistage stochastic mixed integer programming,2009,TOP,5,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67349139106&partnerID=40&md5=6a2060010ea50914c720af6953daec89,"We present a framework for solving large-scale multistage mixed 0-1 optimization problems under uncertainty in the coefficients of the objective function, the right-hand side vector, and the constraint matrix. A scenario tree-based scheme is used to represent the Deterministic Equivalent Model of the stochastic mixed 0-1 program with complete recourse. The constraints are modeled by a splitting variable representation via scenarios. So, a mixed 0-1 model for each scenario cluster is considered, plus the nonanticipativity constraints that equate the 0-1 and continuous so-called common variables from the same group of scenarios in each stage. Given the high dimensions of the stochastic instances in the real world, it is not realistic to obtain the optimal solution for the problem. Instead we use the so-called Fix-and-Relax Coordination (FRC) algorithm to exploit the characteristics of the nonanticipativity constraints of the stochastic model. A mixture of the FRC approach and the Lagrangian Substitution and Decomposition schemes is proposed for satisfying, both, the integrality constraints for the 0-1 variables and the nonanticipativity constraints. © Socieded de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Branch-and-fix coordination; Lagrangian substitution and decomposition; Mean-risk measures; Multistage stochastic integer programming,,"Ahmed, S., Mean-risk objectives in stochastic programming (2004), http://dochost.rz.hu-berlin.de/speps, Stochastic programming e-print seriesAhmed, S., King, A.J., Parija, G., A multi-stage stochastic integer programming approach for capacity expansion under uncertainty (2003) J Glob Optim, 26, pp. 3-24; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Garín, A., Ortuño, M.T., Pérez, G., An approach for strategic supply chain planning based on stochastic 0-1 programming (2003) J Glob Optim, 26, pp. 97-124; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Ortuño, M.T., BFC, a branch-and-fix coordination algorithmic framework for solving some types of stochastic pure and mixed 0-1 programs (2003) Eur J Oper Res, 151, pp. 503-519; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Garín, A., Ortuño, M.T., Pérez, G., On the product selection and plant dimensioning problem under uncertainty (2005) Omega, 33, pp. 307-318; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L.F., Ortuño, M.T., Modeling production planning and scheduling under uncertainty (2005) Applications of Stochastic Programming.

They have analyzed the effect of some dependencies on the Laplace transform of the retained total claim amount. In this note, we study how dependencies influence the variability of the retained and the reinsured total claim amount, under excess-loss and stop-loss reinsurance policies, with stochastic retention levels. Stochastic directional convexity properties, variability orderings, and bounds for the retained and the reinsured total risk are given. Some examples on the calculation of bounds for stop-loss premiums (i.e., the expected value of the reinsured total risk under this treaty) and for net premiums for the cedent company under excess-loss, and complementary results on convex comparisons of discounted values of benefits for the insurer from a portfolio with risks having random policy limits (deductibles) are derived. © Socieded de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Directionally convex functions;

In such a case, the problem should better be analyzed in hierarchical levels. At each level, some temporary solutions are obtained; then a suitable decision fusion technique is used to merge the temporary solutions for the next level. The hierarchical framework proposed in this study depends on reutilization or elimination of previous level local agents that together perform the decisions due to a decision-fusion technique: a performance criterion is set for local agents. The criterion checks the success of agents in their local regions. An agent satisfying this criterion is reutilized in the next level, whereas an agent not successful enough is removed from the agent pool in the next level. In place of a removed agent, a number of new local agents are developed. This framework is applied on a fault detection problem. © Socieded de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Classification; Decision-fusion; Decision-making; Machine learning; Neural networks,,"Ben-Arieh, D., Easton, T., Multi-criteria group consensus under linear cost opinion elasticity (2007) Decis Support Syst, 43, pp. 713-721; Guo, P., Zeng, D.-Z., Shishido, H., Group decision with inconsistent knowledge (2002) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern, 32 (6 PART A), pp. 670-679; Herrera, F., Martínez, L., A model based on linguistic 2-tuples for dealing with multigranular hierarchical linguistic contexts in multiexpert decision-making (2001) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern, 31 (PART B), pp. 227-234; Huynh, V.N., Nakamori, Y., A satisfactory-oriented approach to multiexpert decision-making under linguistic assessments (2005) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern, 35 (PART B), pp. 184-196; Lu, J., Shi, C., Zhang, G., On bilevel multi-follower decision making: General framework and solutions (2006) Inf Sci, 176, pp. 1607-1627; Mikhailov, L., Group prioritization in the AHP by fuzzy preference programming method (2004) Comput Oper Res, 31, pp. 293-301; Pal, B.B., Biswas, A., A fuzzy multilevel programming method for hierarchical decision making (2004) Proceedings of 11th International Conference: Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2004), pp. 904-911. , In:; Pasi, G., Yager, R.R., Modeling the concept of fuzzy majority opinion (2003) Fuzzy Sets and Systems IFSA 2003, 10th International Fuzzy Systems Association World Congress, pp. 143-150. , In: Istanbul, Turkey.

The proposed model considers a medium-term planning horizon and specifically allows optimal replacement and schedule of purchases to be obtained for the first stage. This model takes into account sow herd dynamics, housing facilities, reproduction management, herd size with initial and final inventory of sows and uncertain parameters such as litter size, mortality and fertility rates. These last parameters are explicitly incorporated via a finite set of scenarios. The proposed model is solved by using the algebraic modelling software OPL Studio from ILOG, in combination with the solver CPLEX to solve the linear models resulting from different instances considered. The article also presents results obtained with previous deterministic models assessing the suitability of the stochastic approach. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the study including an outlook are presented. © Socieded de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",Planning; Replacement; Sow herd management; Stochastic programming,,"Albornoz, V.M., Canales, C., Total allowable catch for managing squat lobster fishery using stochastic nonlinear programming (2006) Comput Oper Res, 33, pp. 2113-2124; Albornoz, V.M., Contesse, L., Modelos de Optimización Robusta un Problema de Planificación Agregada de la Producción bajo Incertidumbre en las Demandas (1999) Invest Oper, 7 (3), pp. 1-15; Alonso-Ayuso, A., Escudero, L., Ortuño, M.T., Modelling production planning and scheduling under uncertainty (2005) Applications of Stochastic Programming, , In: Wallace SW, Ziemba WT (eds) SIAM, Philadelphia; Beale, E.M.L., On minimizing a convex function subject to linear inequalities (1955) J R Stat Soc, Ser B, 17, pp. 173-184; Birge, J.R., Louveaux, F.V., Introduction to stochastic programming (1997), Springer, New YorkDantzig, G.B., Linear programming under uncertainty (1955) Manag Sci, 1, pp. 197-206; Escudero, L., Kamesan, P., King, A., Wets, R., Production planning via scenarios modelling (1993) Ann Oper Res, 43, pp. 311-335; Gupta, A., Maranas, C.D., Managing demand uncertainty in supply chain planning (2003) Comput Chem Eng, 27, pp. 1219-1227; Huirne, R.B., Dijkhuizen, A.A., Van Beek, P., Hendriks, T.H.B., Stochastic dynamic programming to support sow replacement decisions (1993) Eur J Oper Res, 67, pp. 161-171; Jalvingh, A.W., Dijkhuizen, A.A., van Arendonk, J.A.M., Dynamic probabilistic modelling of reproduction and management in sow herds.

More precisely, we first present necessary properties that a family of coalitions must satisfy in order to be the blocking family of some game and show that they are sufficient conditions too. Furthermore, a procedure to determine all games having a given blocking family is provided. With regard to uniqueness and multiplicity, (a) the blocking families that univocally determine the game are characterized by means of a separation condition, and (b) it is shown that in the nonseparating case at least three games share each nonempty blocking family, and an upper bound is given for the number of such games. Some numerical examples illustrate our results.

The uncertainty is represented by using a scenario tree and lies anywhere in the model. The problem is modeled by a splitting variable representation of the Deterministic Equivalent Model of the stochastic problem, where the 0-1 variables and the continuous variables appear at any stage. The approach uses the Twin Node Family concept within the algorithmic framework, so-called Branch-and-Fix Coordination, for satisfying the nonanticipativity constraints in the 0-1 variables. Some blocks of additional strategies are used in order to show the performance of the proposed approach. The blocks are related to the scenario clustering, the starting branching and the branching order strategies, among others. Some computational experience is reported.

One of these problems that have appeared during the last few years is the Double Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Stacks (DTSPMS), a vehicle routing problem in which some pickups and deliveries must be performed in two independent networks, verifying some precedence and loading constraints imposed on the vehicle. In this paper, four new neighborhood structures for the DTSPMS based on reinsertion and permutation of orders to modify both the routes and the loading planning of the solutions are introduced and described in detail. They can be used in combination with any metaheuristic using local search as a subprocedure, guiding the search to unexplored zones of the solution space. Some computational results obtained using all proposed neighborhood structures are presented, providing good quality solutions for real sized instances. © Socieded de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2009.",LIFO loading; Metaheuristics; Neighborhood structures; Precedence constraints; Traveling salesman problem,,"Carrabs, F., Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Variable neighborhood search for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with LIFO loading (2007) INFORMS J Comput, 19, pp. 618-632; Cassani, L., Righini, G., Heuristic algorithms for the tsp with rear-loading (2004) 35th Annual Conference of the Italian Operational Research Society, , In: AIRO XXXV, Lecce, Italy; Clarke, G., Wright, J., Scheduling of vehicles from a central depot to a number of delivery points (1964) Oper Res, 12, pp. 568-581; Cordeau, J.-F., Laporte, G., Potvin, J.-Y., Savelsvergh, M.W., Transportation on demand (2006) Handbooks in Operations Research and Management Science, 14. , In: Barnhart C, Laporte G (eds).

For improving the accuracy of automatic forecasting it uses an optimisation-based scheme which unifies the stages of estimation of the parameters and model selection. Based on this scheme, suitable forecasts and prediction intervals are obtained. The performance of the proposed system is compared with a number of well-established automatic forecasting procedures with respect to the 3003 time series included in the M3-competition. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2008.",Decision support systems; Forecasting; Holt-Winters method; Non-linear optimisation,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans Autom Control, 19 (6), pp. 716-723; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., Improving demand forecasting accuracy using non-linear programming software (2006) J Oper Res Soc, 57, pp. 94-100; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., A decision support system methodology for forecasting of time series based on soft computing (2006) Comput Stat Data Anal, 51, pp. 177-191; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., Predicción del consumo de agua con SIOPRED (2007) Actas De Simposio De Inteligencia Computacional SICO'2007, pp. 447-451. , In: Rojas I, Pomares H (eds) Thomson, Madrid; Bermúdez, J.D., Segura, J.V., Vercher, E., Holt-Winters forecasting: An alternative formulation applied to UK air passenger data (2007) J Appl Stat, 34, pp. 1075-1090; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., (1994) Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control, , 3rd edn.

In this work, we present an algorithm for solving an iterative multi-unit combinatorial auction in which the auctioneer computes at each round a linear anonymous price for each item by using a DEA model and pushes bidders to express bids according to them. A computational study is carried out in order to check the performance of the proposed design. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2008.",Auction design; Combinatorial auction; DEA efficiency; Iterative multi-unit auction; Winner-determination algorithm,,"Anderson, A., Tenhnen, M., Ygge, F., Integer programming for combinatorial auction winner determination (2000) Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Multiagent Systems, , In: Boston, MA; Ausubel, L., Milgrom, P., Ascending auctions with package bidding (2002) Front Theor Econ, 1 (1). , www.bepress.com; Banker, R., A game theoretic approach to measuring efficiency (1980) Eur J Oper Res, 5 (4), pp. 262-268; Banker, R.D., Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Clarke, R., Constrained game formulations and interpretations for data envelopment analysis (1989) Eur J Oper Res, 40 (3), pp. 299-308; Bikhchandani, S., Ostroy, J.M., From the assignment model to combinatorial auctions (2006) Combinatorial Auctions, , In: Cramton P, Shoham Y, Steinberg R (eds) MIT Press, Cambridge; Bichler, M., Shabalin, P., Pikovsky, A., A computational analysis of linear price iterative combinatorial auction formats (2007) INFORMS Inf Syst Res, , http://ibis.in.tum.de/staff/bichler/, (to appear); Bogetoft, P., Nielsen, K., DEA based yardstick competition in natural resource management (2002) Recent Accomplishments in Applied Forest Economics Research, , In: Finn H, Niels S, Lars W (eds) Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht; Bogetoft, P., Nielsen, K., DEA based auctions (2008) Eur J Oper Res, 184 (2), pp. 685-700; Bogetoft, P., Boye, K., Neergaard-Petersen, H., Nielsen, K., Reallocating sugar beat contracts: Can sugar production survive in Denmark?

In a generic way, from each starting point, the limit point will be a locally minimal solution, whereas for each possible exceptional situation, a possible solution is indicated.

In spite of its simplicity, logistic regression has shown very good performance in a range of fields. It is widely accepted in a range of fields because its results are easy to interpret. Fitting the logistic regression model usually involves using the principle of maximum likelihood. The Newton-Raphson algorithm is the most common numerical approach for obtaining the coefficients maximizing the likelihood of the data. This work presents a novel approach for fitting the logistic regression model based on estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs), a tool for evolutionary computation. EDAs are suitable not only for maximizing the likelihood, but also for maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Thus, we tackle the logistic regression problem from a double perspective: likelihood-based to calibrate the model and AUC-based to discriminate between the different classes. Under these two objectives of calibration and discrimination, the Pareto front can be obtained in our EDA framework. These fronts are compared with those yielded by a multiobjective EDA recently introduced in the literature. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2008.",Calibration and discrimination; Estimation of distribution algorithms; Evolutionary algorithms; Logistic regression,,"Baumgartner, C., Böhm, C., Baumgartner, D., Marini, G., Weinberger, K., Olgemöller, B., Liebl, B., Roscher, A.A., Supervised machine learning techniques for the classification of metabolic disorders in newborns (2004) Bioinformatics, 20 (17), pp. 2985-2996; Blanco, R., Inza, I., Larrañaga, P., Learning Bayesian networks in the space of structures by estimation of distribution algorithms (2003) Int J Intell Syst, 18, pp. 205-220; Bouckaert, R., Frank, E., Evaluating the replicability of significance tests for comparing learning algorithms (2004) PAKDD.

Like very few other disciplines only, the modeling and prediction of genetical data is requesting mathematics nowadays to deeply understand its foundations. This need is even forced by the rapid changes in a world of globalization. Such a study has to include aspects of stability and tractability; the still existing limitations of modern technology in terms of measurement errors and uncertainty have to be taken into account. In this paper, the important role played by the environment is rigorously introduced into the biological context and connected with employing the theories of optimization and dynamical systems. Especially, a matrix-vector and interval concept and algebra are used; some special attention is paid to splines. From data got by DNA microarray experiments and environmental measurements we extract nonlinear ordinary differential equations. This is done by Chebychev approximation and semi-infinite optimization. Then, time-discretized dynamical systems are studied. By a combinatorial algorithm which constructs and follows polyhedra sequences, the region of parametric stability is detected. This is used for testing and maybe improving the goodness of the achieved model. We analyze the topological landscape of gene-environment networks in terms of structural stability which we characterize. This pioneering practically motivated and theoretically elaborated work is devoted to a contribution to better health care, progress in medicine, better education, and to recommending more healthy living conditions.

The procedure is motivated by the problem of detecting an early change in the mean of returns and is based on the CUSUM (cumulative sum) statistic. It terminates when the CUSUM crosses a boundary function or the number of collected observations reaches a prescribed number. We show that the stopping time is asymptotically normal. Simulations using models derived from returns on indexes and individual stocks show that the normal approximation holds in finite samples. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.,Asymptotic normality; Change in the mean; CUSUM; Sequential detection,,"Andrews, D.W.K., Monahan, J.C., An improved heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimator (1992) Econometrica, 60, pp. 953-966; Aue, A., Testing for parameter stability in RCA(1) time series (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 3070-3089; Aue, A., Horváth, L., Delay time in sequential detection of change (2004) Stat Probab Lett, 67, pp. 221-231; Aue, A., Berkes, I., Horváth, L., Strong approximation for the sums of squares of augmented GARCH sequences (2006) Bernoulli, 12, pp. 583-608; Aue, A., Horváth, L., Hušková, M., Kokoszka, P., Change-point monitoring in linear models (2006) Econom J, 9, pp. 373-403; Basseville, M., Nikiforov, I.V., (1993) Detection of Abrupt Changes: Theory and Applications, , Prentice Hall Englewood Cliffs; Berkes, I., Horváth, L., Kokoszka, P., Shao, Q.-M., Almost sure convergence of the Bartlett estimator (2005) Period Math Hung, 51, pp. 11-25; Berkes, I., Horváth, L., Kokoszka, P., Shao, Q.-M., On discriminating between long-range dependence and changes in mean (2006) Ann Stat, 34, pp. 1140-1165; Carrasco, M., Chen, X., Mixing and moment properties of various GARCH and stochastic volatility models (2002) Econom Theory, 18, pp. 17-39; C-Sj, C., Stinchcombe, M., White, H., Monitoring structural change (1996) Econometrica, 64, pp. 1045-1065; Gencay, R., Selcuk, F., Whitcher, B., (2002) An Introduction to Wavelets and Other Filtering Methods in Finance and Economics, , Academic San Diego; Giraitis, L., Kokoszka, P., Leipus, R., Teyssiere, G., Rescaled variance and related tests for long memory in volatility and levels (2003) J Econom, 112, pp. 265-294; Gorodetskii, V.V., On the strong mixing property for linear processes (1977) Theory Probab Appl, 22, pp. 411-413; Gustafsson, F., (2000) Adaptive Filtering and Change Detection, , Wiley New York; Horváth, L., Hušková, M., Kokoszka, P., Steinebach, J., Monitoring changes in linear models (2004) J Stat Plan Inference, 126, pp. 225-251; Horváth, L., Kokoszka, P., Steinebach, J., On sequential detection of parameter changes in linear regression (2007) Stat Probab Lett (Forthcoming); Leisch, F., Hornik, K., Kuan, C.-M., Monitoring structural changes with the generalized fluctuation test (2000) Econom Theory, 16, pp. 835-854; Sul, D., Phillips, P.C.B., Choi, C.-Y., Prewhitening bias in HAC estimation (2005) Oxf Bull Econ Stat, 67, pp. 517-546; Withers, C.S., Conditions for linear processes to be strong-mixing (1981) Z Wahrsch Verwandte Geb, 57, pp. 477-480; Zeileis, A., Leisch, F., Kleiber, C., Hornik, K., Monitoring structural change in dynamic econometric models (2005) J Appl Econom, 20, pp. 99-121; Zhang, A., Gabrys, R., Kokoszka, P., (2006) Discriminating between Long Memory and Volatility Shifts, , Preprint",English,Article

This extends the standard approach of enforcing unnecessary parameter restrictions. A VECH model specification is proposed allowing both parsimony and parameter interpretability, opposing existing specifications that achieve only one of these. A Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, employing Metropolis-Hastings and delayed rejection, is designed. A simulation study shows favourable estimation and improved coverage of intervals, compared with classical methods.

This requires assigning a corresponding collection of prior distributions, one for each model's parameter space. In this paper we address the issue of relating priors across models, and provide both a conceptual and a pragmatic justification for this task. Specifically, we consider the notion of ""compatible"" priors across models, and discuss and compare several strategies to construct such distributions.

Once the models have been encompassed, one can define objective priors for the multiple testing problem involved in the variable selection problem. There are two natural ways of encompassing: one way is to encompass all models into the model containing all possible regressors, and the other is to encompass the model containing only the intercept into any other. In this paper we compare the variable selection procedures that result from each of the two mentioned ways of encompassing by analysing their theoretical properties and their behavior with simulated and real data.

When the prior information on the parameters of the models is vague default priors are typically used. Unfortunately, these priors are usually improper provoking a calibration problem which precludes the comparison of the models. An attempt for solving this difficulty consists in using intrinsic priors, introduced in Berger and Pericchi (1996, The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction. J Am Stat Assoc 91:109-122), instead of the original default priors; however, there are situations where the class of intrinsic priors is too large. Because of this we propose prior distributions for model selection that are solutions of a system of integral equations which is derived to calibrate the initial default priors. Under some assumptions our integral equations yield a unique solution.

We treat α as an unknown parameter, but for theoretical simplicity we also consider the case that α is fixed. For estimation of parameters and the standardization of data we use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). We derive the asymptotic covariance function of the characteristic function process with parameters estimated by MLE. The eigenvalues of the covariance function are numerically evaluated and the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is obtained using complex integration. We find that if the sample size is large the calculated asymptotic critical values of test statistics coincide with the simulated finite sample critical values. Finite sample power of the proposed test is examined. We also present a formula of the asymptotic covariance function of the characteristic function process with parameters estimated by an efficient estimator for general distributions. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Goodness-of-fit tests; Integral equations; Maximum likelihood estimator; Stable distributions,,"Anderson, T.W., Darling, D.A., Asymptotic theory of certain ""goodness of fit"" criteria based on stochastic processes (1952) Ann Math Stat, 23, pp. 193-212; Csörgo, S., Kernel-transformed empirical process (1983) J Multivar Anal, 13, pp. 517-533; Csörgo, S., Testing for normality in arbitrary dimension (1986) Ann Stat, 14, pp. 708-732; Csörgo, S., Consistency of some tests for multivariate normality (1989) Metrika, 36, pp. 107-116; Dumouchel, W.H., On the asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood estimate when sampling from a stable distribution (1973) Ann Stat, 1, pp. 948-957; Durbin, J., (1973) Distribution Theory for Tests Based on the Sample Distribution Function, , SIAM Philadelphia; Durbin, J., Weak convergence of the sample distribution function when parameters are estimated (1973) Ann Stat, 1, pp. 279-290; Feller, W., (1971) An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, Vol 2, , 2 Wiley New York; GNU-Scientific-Library (2005) GNU Scientific Library-Reference Manual.

Benjamini and Hochberg (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 57(1):289-300, 1995) provide a method for controlling the FDR based on p-values for each of the null hypotheses under the assumption that the p-values are independent. Subsequent research has since shown that this procedure is valid under weaker assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values. Related procedures that are valid under no assumptions on the joint distribution of the p-values have also been developed. None of these procedures, however, incorporate information about the dependence structure of the test statistics. This paper develops methods for control of the FDR under weak assumptions that incorporate such information and, by doing so, are better able to detect false null hypotheses. We illustrate this property via a simulation study and two empirical applications. In particular, the bootstrap method is competitive with methods that require independence if independence holds, but it outperforms these methods under dependence. © 2008 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bootstrap; False discovery rate; Multiple testing; Stepdown procedure; Subsampling,,"Abramovich, F., Benjamini, Y., Adaptive thresholding of wavelet coefficients (1996) Comput Stat Data Anal, 22, pp. 351-361; Abramovich, F., Benjamini, Y., Donoho, D.L., Johnstone, I.M., Adapting to unknown sparsity by controlling the false discovery rate (2006) Ann Stat, 34, pp. 584-653. , 2; Andrews, D.W.K., Monahan, J.C., An improved heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimator (1992) Econometrica, 60, pp. 953-966; Basford, K.E., Tukey, J.W., Graphical profiles as an aid to understanding plant breeding experiments (1997) J Stat Plann Inference, 57, pp. 93-107; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing (1995) J R Stat Soc ser B, 57, pp. 289-300. , 1; Benjamini, Y., Hochberg, Y., On the adaptive control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing with independent statistics (2000) J Educ Behav Stat, 25, pp. 60-83. , 1; Benjamini, Y., Liu, W., A stepdown multiple hypotheses testing procedure that controls the false discovery rate under independence (1999) J Stat Plann Inference, 82, pp. 163-170; Benjamini, Y., Yekutieli, D., The control of the false discovery rate in multiple testing under dependency (2001) Ann Stat, 29, pp. 1165-1188. , 4; Benjamini, Y., Krieger, A.M., Yekutieli, D., Adaptive linear step-up procedures that control the false discovery rate (2006) Biometrika, 93, pp. 491-507. , 3; Davison, A.C., Hinkley, D.V., (1997) Bootstrap Methods and Their Application, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Drigalenko, E.I., Elston, R.C., False discoveries in genome scanning (1997) Genet Epidemiol, 15, pp. 779-784; Efron, B., Bootstrap methods: Another look at the jackknife (1979) Ann Stat, 7, pp. 1-26; Efron, B., Tibshirani, R.J., (1993) An Introduction to the Bootstrap, , Chapman & Hall New York; Genovese, C.R., Wasserman, L., A stochastic process approach to false discovery control (2004) Ann Stat, 32, pp. 1035-1061. , 3; Götze, F., Künsch, H.R., Second order correctness of the blockwise bootstrap for stationary observations (1996) Ann Stat, 24, pp. 1914-1933; Hommel, G., Hoffman, T., Bauer, P., Hommel, G., Sonnemann, E., Controlled uncertainty (1988) Multiple Hypothesis Testing, pp. 154-161. , Springer Heidelberg; Joe, H., Generating random correlation matrices based on partial correlations (2006) J Multivar Anal, 97, pp. 2177-2189; Kat, H.M., 10 things investors should know about hedge funds (2003) AIRC Working Paper 0015, , http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/airc/papers.html, Cass Business School, City University.

By studying the sample paths of these statistics, changes in residual dependence can be detected that might be missed by statistics using only the total sum of cross-products. Also, a test statistic for white noise is proposed. It is shown that the limiting distribution of the test statistic converges weakly to a vector Brownian motion with independent elements under the null hypothesis of no residual autocorrelation. An indication of the circumstances under which the asymptotic results apply in finite-sample situations is obtained through a simulation study. Some considerations are given to the empirical size and power of the test statistic vis-à-vis the Ljung-Box (Biometrika 65:297-303, 1978) portmanteau statistic, and a diagnostic test statistic proposed by Peña and Rodriguez (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 97:601-610, 2002).

Different constraints lead to different well-known generalizations of the normal distribution. As an immediate consequence, evaluation of several features of these maxima is greatly simplified. The results of the paper are also useful in modeling other phenomena, such as measures of physical fitness based on the best of two trials. Further applications deal with statistical inference, for example, testing whether an identified treatment is best. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Canonical fundamental skew-normal distribution; Exchangeability; Extended skew-normal distribution; Multivariate skew-normal distribution; Nonlinear prediction,,"Aldous, D.J., Exchangeability and related topics (1985) Springer Series in Statistics, , In: Hennequin PL (ed) Ecole d'été de probabilités de Saint-Flour, XIII.

In the case of density forecasts, Box's density ordinate transform provides an attractive alternative. The multivariate energy score generalizes the continuous ranked probability score.

In this paper, we obtain good analytic approximations for the p-value and critical value of tests in which the test statistic is a ratio of sums of squares of independent and identically distributed random variables (i.e., F-tests under a normal) when the underlying distribution is close to but different from the normal. The class of distributions for the approximations to be valid is delimited with a ""breakdown condition."" With these approximations, we can study, for example, the robustness of validity of this kind of tests and corroborate the thought that they have robustness of validity if only the second degree of freedom depends on a large n and that they do not have robustness of validity if both degrees of freedom depend on n and are similar. These robustness properties are displayed with the ""Robustness of Validity Plot,"" a diagram of the nominal level versus the actual level of a test.

In this paper, we give a recursive formula to compute the reliability of such a system. Thereafter, we state two asymptotic results concerning the failure time Zn of the system. The first result concerns a limit theorem for Zn when the failure times of components are not necessarily with identical failure distributions. In the second one, we prove that, for an arbitrary common failure distribution of components, the limit system failure distribution is always of the Poisson class. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Arbitrary component failure distribution; Consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system; M-consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system; Poisson limit law; Recursive formula,,"Boland, P.J., Papastavridis, S.G., Consecutive-k-out-of-n: F systems with cycle k (1999) Stat Probab Lett, 44, pp. 155-160; Boushaba, M., Ghoraf, N., m-consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system via consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system (2002) 8th ISSAT International Conference on Reliability and Quality in Design, pp. 171-174. , Anaheim California USA, 9 August; Chao, M.T., Fu, J.C., Koutras, M.V., Survey of reliability studies of consecutive-k-out-of-n: F & related systems (1995) IEEE Trans on Reliab, 40, pp. 120-127; Chrysaphinou, O., Papastavridis, S.G., Limit distribution for a consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system (1990) Adv Appl Probab, 22, pp. 491-493; Derman, C., Lieberman, G.J., Ross, S.M., On the consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system (1982) IEEE Trans Reliab, 31, pp. 57-63; Fu, J.C., Poisson convergence in reliability of a large linearly connected system as related to coin tossing (1993) Stat Sin, 3, pp. 261-275; Ghoraf, N., Boushaba, M., Fast formula of a reliability of m-consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system with cycle k (2003) Soc Estad Investig Oper Top, 11, pp. 275-283; Ghoraf, N., Ksir, B., A Weibull limit law for the failure time of consecutive-k-out-of-m-from-n: F system (2006) Int J Reliab Qual Saf Eng, 13, pp. 421-431; Griffith, W.S., On consecutive-k-out-of-n failure systems and their generalizations (1986) Reliability and Quality Control, pp. 157-165. , In: Basu AP (ed); Hwang, F.K., Fast solutions for consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system (1982) IEEE Trans Reliab, 31, pp. 447-448; Koutras, M.V., On a Markov chain approach for the study of reliability structures (1996) J Appl Probab, 33, pp. 357-367; Milczek, B., On the class of limit reliability functions of homogeneous series-""k-out-of-n"" systems (2003) Appl Math Comput, 137, pp. 161-176; Papastatvridis, S.G., A limit theorem for the reliability of a consecutive k-out-of-n system (1987) Adv Appl Probab, 19, pp. 746-748; Papastavridis, S.G., m-consecutive-k-out-of-n: F systems (1990) IEEE Trans Reliab, 39, pp. 386-388",English,Article

Using this knowledge, he can develop a policy that will ensure the largest net profit. Considering the fact, a two-warehousing inventory model has been developed where the demand is price-sensitive under the bulk release rule. Stockouts are allowed and are fully backlogged.

The high level algorithm is suggested by Gonzaga et al. (SIAM J. Optim. 14:646-669, 2003) but not yet implement - the internal algorithms are not proposed. The filter, a new concept introduced by Fletcher and Leyffer (Math. Program. Ser.

In the IR approach two independent phases are performed in each iteration, the feasibility and the optimality phases. The line search filter is combined with the first one phase to generate a ""more feasible"" point, and then it is used in the optimality phase to reach an ""optimal"" point.

The goal is to locate a service facility minimizing the weighted sum of average distances (measured with ℓp norms) to these demand hypercubes. In order to do that, we present an iterative scheme that provides a sequence converging to an optimal solution of the problem for p ∈[1,2]. For the planar case, analytical expressions of this iterative procedure are obtained for p=2 and p=1, where two different approaches are proposed. The paper ends with a computational analysis of the proposed methodology, comparing its efficiency with a standard minimizer. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2008.",Average distance; Weber problem; Weiszfeld algorithm,,"Beckenbach, E.F., Bellman, R., (1965) Inequalities, , 2nd edn.

We develop a Bayesian procedure to test simple null hypotheses versus bilateral alternatives in contingency tables. We consider testing equality of proportions of independent multinomial distributions when the common proportions are known. A lower bound of the posterior probabilities of the null hypothesis is calculated with respect to a mixture of a point prior on the null and an ε-contaminated prior on the proportions under the alternative. The resulting Bayes tests are compared numerically to Pearson's χ 2 in a number of examples. For the examined examples the lower bound and the p-value can be made close. The obtained results are generalized when the common proportions vector under the null is unknown or has a known functional form. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.,ε-contaminated priors; Contingency tables; Critical region; P-values; Posterior probabilities; Reconciliation; Test statistic,,"Berger, J.O., (1985) Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, , Springer New York; Berger, J.O., An overview over robust Bayesian analysis (with discussion) (1994) Test, 3, pp. 5-124. , 1; Berger, J.O., Berliner, L.M., Robust Bayes and empirical Bayes analysis with ε-contaminated priors (1986) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 13, pp. 395-400; Berger, J.O., Boukai, B., Wang, Y., Unified frequentest and Bayesian testing of a precise hypothesis (1997) Stat Sci, 12, pp. 133-160. , 3; Berger, J.O., Delampady, M., Testing precise hypotheses (with discussion) (1987) Stat Sci, 2, pp. 317-352. , 3; Berger, J.O., Sellke, T., Testing a point null hypothesis: The irreconcilability of p-values and evidence (with discussion) (1987) J Am Stat Assoc, 82, pp. 112-139; Bernardo, J.M., Bernardo, J.M., Degroot, M.H., Lindley, D.V., Smith, A.F.M., A Bayesian analysis of classical hypothesis testing (with discussion) (1980) Bayesian Statistics, pp. 605-647. , Valencia University Press Valencia; Casella, G., Berger, R.L., Reconciling Bayesian and frequentest evidence in the one-sided testing problem (with discussion) (1987) J Am Stat Assoc, 82, pp. 106-135; Cox, D.R., Hinkley, D.V., (1974) Theoretical Statistics, , Chapman & Hall London; Degroot, M.H., Reaching a consensus (1974) J Am Stat Assoc, 68, pp. 966-969; Dickey, J.M., Lienz, B.P., The weighted likelihood ratio, sharp hypothesis about chances, the order of a Markov chain (1970) Ann Math Stat, 41, pp. 214-226; Edwards, W.L., Lindman, H., Savage, L.J., Bayesian statistical inference for psychological research (1963) Psychol Rev, 70, pp. 193-248; Ghosh, J.K., Mukerjee, R., Bernardo, J.M., Berger, J.O., Dawid, A.P., Smith, A.F.M., Non-informative priors (with discussion) (1992) Bayesian Statistics, pp. 195-210. , Oxford University Press Oxford; Gómez-Villegas, M.A., Gómez, E., Bayes factor in testing precise hypotheses (1992) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 21, pp. 1707-1715; Gómez-Villegas, M.A., Maín, P., Sanz, L., A suitable Bayesian approach in testing point null hypothesis: Some examples revisited (2002) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 31, pp. 201-217. , 2; Ma, G., Maín, P., Sanz, L., (2004) A Bayesian Analysis for the Multivariate Point Null Testing Problem, , Tech.

As analogies of the intraclass and interclass correlations of a normally distributed trait, we study intraclass and interclass (log) odds ratios for a binary trait. We propose non-parametric estimators of the odds ratios and derive the asymptotic variances of the estimators under the assumptions of exchangeability and closure of multivariate binary distributions under marginals. These estimators are straightforward, except for the consideration of how to weight by family size. The relative efficiencies of the non-parametric estimators are studied for some parametric models. It shows that our estimators are highly efficient, and that weighting by family size is recommended for the intraclass odds ratio.

The proposed method is based on the Bayesian paradigm and provides posterior probabilities that a new vector belongs to each of the classes, therefore it adapts naturally to any number of classes. The classification technique is based on a small vector which can be viewed as a regression of the new observation onto the space spanned by the training samples, which is similar to Support Vector Machine classification paradigm. This is achieved by employing matrix-variate distributions in classification, which is an entirely new idea. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Decision theory; Matrix-variate normal distribution; Posterior probabilities; Support vector machine,,"Amato, U., Antoniadis, A., Grègoire, G., Independent component discriminant analysis (2003) Int Math J, 3, pp. 735-753; Bradshaw, D., (2005) Classification of High-dimensional Vectors Based on Matrix-variate Distributions, , PhD thesis, University of Central Florida, Orlando; Burges, C., A tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition (1998) Data Min Knowledge Discov, 2, pp. 121-167; Choi, S.C., Classification of multiply observed data (1972) Biom J, 14, pp. 8-11; Cristianini, N., Shawe-Taylor, J., (2000) An Introduction to Support Vector Machines, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Duda, R.O., Hart, P.E., Stork, D.G., (2001) Pattern Classification, , Wiley New York; Gupta, A.K., On a classification rule for multiple measurements (1986) Comput Math Appl, 12, pp. 301-308; Gupta, A.K., Logan, T.P., On multiple observations model in discriminant analysis (1990) J Stat Comput Simul, 34, pp. 119-132; Gupta, A.K., Nagar, D.K., (2000) Matrix Variate Distributions, , Chapman and Hall/CRC Boca Raton; Jajuga, K., Sokolowski, A., Bock, H., (2001) Classification, Clustering, and Data Analysis, , Springer Berlin; Krzanowski, W.J., Marriott, F.H., (1995) Multivariate Analysis: Part 2, Classification, Covariance Structures & Repeated Measurements, , Edward Arnold London; Lee, Y., Lin, Y., Wahba, G., Multicategory support vector machines: Theory and applications to the classification of microarray data and satellite radiance data (2004) J Am Stat Assoc, 99, pp. 67-81. , 465; Liang, J., Li, R., Fang, H., Fang, K., Testing multinormality based on low-dimensional projection (2000) J Stat Plan Inference, 86, pp. 129-141; Lin, Y., Support vector machines and the Bayes rule in classification (2002) Data Min Knowl Discov, 6, pp. 259-275; Mallick, B.K., Ghosh, D., Ghosh, M., Bayesian classification of tumors using gene expression data (2005) J Roy Stat Soc B, 67, pp. 219-234; Tan, M., Fang, H., Tian, G., Wei, G., Testing multivariate normality in incomplete data of small sample size (2005) J Multivar Anal, 93, pp. 164-179; Vapnik, V.N., (1998) Statistical Learning Theory, , Wiley New York; Wahba, G., Soft and hard classification by reproducing kernel Hilbert space methods (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 99, pp. 14524-16530",English,Article

In these settings, statistical analyses that require the inversion of covariance matrices, such as those pursuing supervised dimension reduction or the assessment of interdependence structures, are problematic. In this article we show how the idea of adding noise to the bootstrap, pioneered by Efron, and Silverman and Young, in the late seventies and eighties, can be used to overcome undersampling and effectively estimate the inverse covariance matrix for data sets in which the number of observations is small relative to the number of variables. We demonstrate the performance of this approach, which we call augmented bootstrap, on simulated data and on data derived from genomic DNA sequences and microarray experiments. © 2008 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Genomics; Inverse covariance; Large-p-small-n; Resampling,,"Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Mach Learn, 24, pp. 123-140. , 2; Buhlmann, P., Yu, B., Analyzing bagging (2002) Ann Stat, 30, pp. 927-961. , 4; Carrel, L., Willard, H.F., X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females (2005) Nature, 434, pp. 400-404; Carrel, L., Park, C., Tyekucheva, S., Dunn, J., Chiaromonte, F., Makova, K.D., Genomic environment predicts expression patterns on the human inactive x chromosome (2006) PLoS Genet, 2, pp. 1477-1486. , 9; Cherry, J.M., Ball, C., Weng, S., Juvik, G., Schmidt, R., Adler, C., Dunn, B., Botstein, D., Genetic and physical maps of saccharomyces cerevisiae (1997) Nature, 387, pp. 67-73; Cook, R.D., Li, B., Chiaromonte, F., Dimension reduction in regression without matrix inversion (2007) Biometrika, 94, pp. 569-584. , 3; De Angelis, D., Young, G.A., Smoothing the bootstrap (1992) Int Stat Rev, 60, pp. 45-56. , 1; Efron, B., Bootstrap methods: Another look at jackknife (1979) Ann Stat, 7, pp. 1-26; Fernholz, L., (1983) Von Mises Calculus for Statistical Functionals Lecture Notes in Statistics, 19. , Springer New York; Friedman, J., Hall, P., (2000) On Bagging and Nonlinear Estimation, , Preprint; Gasch, A.P., Spellman, P.T., Kao, C.M., Carmel-Harel, O., Eisen, M.B., Storz, G., Botstein, D., Brown, P.O., Genomic expression programs in the response of yeast cells to environmental changes (2000) Mol Biol Cell, 11, pp. 4241-4257. , 12; Gunsalus, K., Ge, H., Schetter, A., Goldberg, D., Han, J.D.J., Hao, T., Berriz, G., Piano, F., Predictive models of molecular machines involved in caenorhabditis elegans early embryogenesis (2005) Nature, 436, pp. 861-865; Hall, P., Diciccio, T., Romano, J.P., On smoothing and the bootstrap (1989) Ann Stat, 17, pp. 692-704. , 2; Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J., (2001) The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, , Springer New York; Helland, I.S., On structure of partial least squares regression (1990) Scand J Stat, 17, pp. 97-114; Kamat, A.R., Incomplete and absolute moments of the multivariate normal distribution with some applications (1981) Biometrika, 40, pp. 20-34. , 1/2; Lashkari, D.A., De Risi, J.L., Namath, A.F., Gentile, C., Hwang, S.Y., Brown, P.O., Davis, R.W., Yeast microarrays for genome wide parallel genetic and gene expression analysis (1997) PNAS USA, 94, pp. 13057-13062. , 24; Ledoit, O., Wolf, M., Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection (2003) J Empir Finance, 10, pp. 603-621; Lee, T.I., Rinaldi, N.J., Robert, F., Odom, D.T., Bar-Joseph, Z., Gerber, G.K., Hannett, N.M., Young, R.A., Transcriptional regulatory networks in saccharomyces cerevisiae (2002) Science, 298, pp. 799-804. , 5594; Lezon, T.R., Banavar, J.R., Cieplak, M., Maritan, A., Fedoroff, N.V., Using the principle of entropy maximization to infer genetic interaction networks from gene expression patterns (2006) PNAS USA, 103, pp. 19033-19038; Li, K.C., Sliced inverse regression for dimension reduction (1991) JASA, 86, pp. 316-327. , 414; Nei, M., Kumar, S., (2000) Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics, , Oxford University Press Oxford; Penrose, R.A., A generalized inverse for matrices (1955) Proc Camb Philos Soc, 51, pp. 406-413; Rao, C.R., Mitra, S.K., (1971) Generalized Inverse of Matrices and Its Applications, , Wiley New York; Raudys, S., Duin, R.P.W., Expected classification error of the Fisher linear classifier with pseudoinverse covariance matrix (1998) Pattern Recogn Lett, 19, pp. 385-392; Ross, M.T., Grafham, D.V., Coffey, A.J., Scherer, S., Muzny, D., Platzer, M., Howell, G.R., Bird, C.P., The DNA sequence of the human X chromosome (2005) Nature, 434, pp. 325-337; Schäfer, J., Strimmer, K., An empirical Bayes approach to inferring large-scale gene association networks (2005) Bioinformatics, 21, pp. 754-764. , 6; Schäfer, J., Strimmer, K., A shrinkage approach to large-scale covariance matrix estimation and implications for functional genomics (2005) Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol, 4, p. 32. , 1; Silverman, B.W., Young, G.A., The bootstrap: To smooth or not to smooth?

The null as well as the non-null distributions are derived for the balanced as well as unbalanced cases. The results show that these statistics have asymptotic normal distributions. A simulation study reveals the approximations are quite good for number of treatments as small as 15 in the null case. Hence, the results can be applied in real life situation where the assumption of multivariate normality is not tenable.

Scand J Stat 12:171-178), can be a suitable model for the analysis of data exhibiting a unimodal density having some skewness present, a structure often occurring in data analysis. It has been observed that there are some practical problems in estimating the skewness parameter for small to moderate sample sizes. In this paper we point out those problems and propose another skewed model which we call ""Power normal model"". The basic structural properties of the proposed model including its reliability properties are presented. The closeness of skew normal and power normal distributions is investigated. It is shown that the proposed model has some nice properties which make it feasible to study the estimation and testing of the skewness parameter. This can be achieved by transforming the data to the exponential model which has been studied extensively in the literature. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Estimation and testing; Generalized skew normal distribution; Skewed normal distribution; Skewness parameter,,"Arnold, B.C., Beaver, R.J., Skewed multivariate models related to hidden truncation and/or selective reporting (2002) Test, 11, pp. 7-54. , 2; Arnold, B.C., Beaver, R.J., Groeneveld, R.A., Meeker, W.Q., The nontruncated marginal of a truncated bivariate normal distribution (1993) Psychometrika, 58, pp. 471-488. , 3; Azzalini, A.A., A class of distributions which include the normal (1985) Scand J Stat, 12, pp. 171-178; Azzalini, A.A., Capitanio, A., Statistical applications of the multivariate skew-normal distribution (1999) J Roy Stat Soc ser B, 61, pp. 579-602; Block, H.W., Savits, T.H., Singh, H., The reversed hazard rate function (1998) Probab Eng Inf Sci, 12, pp. 69-90; Chiogna, M., (1997) Note on Estimation Problems with Scalar Skew-normal Distribution, , Technical Report 1997.15, Department of Statistical Science, University of Padua, Italy; Fernandez, A.J., Bravo, J.I., De Feuentes, I., Computing maximum likelihood estimates from type II doubly censored exponential data (2002) Stat Methods Appl, 11, pp. 187-200; Genton, M.G., (2004) Skew-elliptical Distributions and Their Applications, , Chapman and Hall New York; Gupta, R.C., Brown, N., Reliability studies of skew-normal distribution and its application to strength-stress model (2001) Commun Stat, 30, pp. 2427-2445. , 11; Gupta, R.C., Gupta, P.L., Gupta, R.D., Modeling failure time data by Lehman alternatives (1998) Commun Stat, 27, pp. 887-904. , 4; Gupta, R.C., Gupta, R.D., Generalized skew normal model (2004) Test, 13, pp. 501-524. , 2; Gupta, R.C., Snua, K., On the order relations between reliability measures of two distributions (1987) Stoch Model, 3, pp. 149-156. , 1; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Generalized exponential distributions (1999) Aust New Zealand J Stat, 41, pp. 173-188; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Exponentiated exponential family; An alternative to gamma and Weibull distributions (2001) Biom J, 43, pp. 117-130; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Generalized exponential distribution: Different methods of estimation (2001) J Stat Comput Simul, 69, pp. 315-337; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Generalized exponential distribution: Statistical inferences (2002) J Stat Theory Appl, 1, pp. 101-118; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Closeness of Gamma and generalized exponential distributions (2003) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 32, pp. 705-722; Gupta, R.D., Kundu, D., Discrimination between the Weibull and Generalized exponential distribution (2003) Comput Stat Data Anal, 43, pp. 179-196; Lehman, E.L., The power of rank tests (1953) Ann Math Stat, 24, pp. 28-43; Lillo, R.E., Nanda, A.K., Shaked, M., (2000) Preservation of Some Likelihood Ratio Stochastic Orders by Order Statistics, , Technical report, University of Arizona; Liseo, B., La classe delle densita normali sghembe: Aspetti inferenziali da un punto di vista bayesiano (in Italian) (1990) Stat, 50, pp. 59-70; Liseo, B., Loperfido, N., A note on reference priors for the scalar skew-normal distribution (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 373-389. , 2; Monti, A.C., A note on the estimation of the skew normal and the skew exponential power distributions (2003) Metron, 61, pp. 205-219. , 2; Pewsey, A., Problems on inference for Azzalini's skew-normal distribution (2000) J Appl Stat, 27, pp. 859-870; Sartori, N., Bias prevention of maximum likelihood estimates for scalar skew normal and skew t distributions (2006) J Stat Plan Inference, 136, pp. 4259-4275. , 12",English,Article

One is defined as usual and the other belongs to the family of weighted spaces. Adopting the maxiset approach, we show that a natural hard thresholding procedure attained the minimax rate of convergence within a logarithmic factor over such weighted Besov balls. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Besov spaces; Gaussian noise; Maxiset; Minimax; Muckenhoupt weights; Warped wavelets; Wavelet thresholding,,"Autin, F., (2005) Point de Vue Maxiset en Estimation Non Paramétrique, , PhD thesis, Laboratoire de probabilités et modèles aléatoires, Université Paris VII; Brown, L.D., Low, M.G., Asymptotic equivalence of nonparametric regression and white noise (1996) Ann Stat, 24, pp. 2384-2398; Cohen, A., Daubechies, I., Jawerth, B., Vial, P., Wavelets on the interval and fast wavelet transforms (1993) Appl Comput Harmon Anal, 24, pp. 54-81; Cohen, A., Devore, R., Kerkyacharian, G., Picard, D., Maximal spaces with given rate of convergence for thresholding algorithms (2000) Appl Comput Harmon Anal, 11, pp. 167-191. , 1; Coifman, R., Fefferman, C., Weighted norm inequalities for maximal functions and singular integrals (1974) Stud Math, 51, pp. 241-250; Daubechies, I., Ten lectures on wavelets (1992) CBMS-NSF Regional Conference Series in Applied Mathematics, , SIAM Philadelphia; Donoho, D.L., Johnstone, I.M., Adaptating to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage (1995) J Am Stat Assoc, 90, pp. 1200-1224. , 432; Efromovich, S., Pinsker, M.S., Sharp-optimal and adaptive estimation for heteroscedastic nonparametric regression (1996) Stat Sin, 6, pp. 925-942; García-Cuerva, J., Martell, B., Wavelet characterization of weighted spaces (2001) J Geom Anal, 11, pp. 241-264. , 2; Grama, I., Nussbaum, M., Asymptotic equivalence for nonparametric generalized linear models (1998) Probab Theory Relat Fields, 111, pp. 167-214; Hardle, W., Kerkyacharian, G., Picard, D., Tsybakov, A., (1998) Lecture Notes in Statistics, 129. , Springer New York; Ibragimov, I.A., Khaminskii, R.Z., On the estimation of an infinite dimensional parameter in Gaussian white noise (1977) Sov Math Dokl, 236, pp. 1053-1055. , 5; Kerkyacharian, G., Picard, D., Thresholding algorithms, maxisets and well concentred bases (2000) Test, 9, pp. 283-345. , 2; Kerkyacharian, G., Picard, D., (2003) Non-linear Approximation and Muckenhoupt Weights, , Prepint, Université Paris VI; Kerkyacharian, G., Picard, D., Regression in random design and warped wavelets (2005) Bernouilli, 10, pp. 1053-1105. , 6; Meyer, Y., (1990) Ondelettes et Opérateurs, , Hermann Paris; Muckenhoupt, B., Weighted norm inequalities for the Hardy maximal function (1972) Trans Am Math Soc, 165, pp. 207-226; Nussbaum, M., Asymptotic equivalence of density estimation and white noise (1996) Ann Stat, 24, pp. 2399-2430; Qui, B.H., Weighted Besov and Triebel spaces: Interpolation by the real method (1982) Hiroshima Math J, 12, pp. 581-605; Stein, E., Harmonic analysis: Real-variable methods, orthogonality, and oscillatory integrals (1993) Monographs in Harmonic Analysis, III, 43. , Princeton mathematical series.

Flexible and refined statistical models are widely sought in a large array of statistical problems. The question arises frequently whether or not a family of parametric or nonparametric models fit adequately the given data. In this paper we give a selective overview on nonparametric inferences using generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) statistics. We introduce generalized likelihood ratio statistics to test various null hypotheses against nonparametric alternatives. The trade-off between the flexibility of alternative models and the power of the statistical tests is emphasized. Well-established Wilks' phenomena are discussed for a variety of semi- and non-parametric models, which sheds light on other research using GLR tests. A number of open topics worthy of further study are given in a discussion section. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Asymptotic null distribution; Bootstrap; Generalized likelihood ratio; Nonparametric test; Power function; Wilks' phenomenon,,"Aït-Sahalia, Y., Fan, J., Peng, H., (2005) Nonparametric Transition-based Tests for Jump-diffusions, , Unpublished manuscript; Anderson, T.W., Goodness of fit tests for spectral distributions (1993) Ann Stat, 21, pp. 830-847; Azzalini, A., Bowman, A.N., Härdle, W., On the use of nonparametric regression for model checking (1989) Biometrika, 76, pp. 1-11; Barnard, G.A., Jenkins, G.M., Winsten, C.B., Likelihood inference and time series (1962) J R Stat Soc ser A, 125, pp. 321-372; Berger, J.O., Wolpert, R.L., (1988) The Likelihood Principle, , 2 Institute of Mathematical Statistics Haywood; Bickel, P.J., Ritov, Y., Estimating integrated squared density derivatives: Sharp order of convergence estimates (1988) Sankhyā ser A, 50, pp. 381-393; Bickel, P.J., Rosenblatt, M., On some global measures of the deviation of density function estimates (1973) Ann Stat, 1, pp. 1071-1095; Birnbaum, A., On the foundations of statistical inference (with discussion) (1962) J Am Stat Assoc, 57, pp. 269-326; Brillinger, D.R., (1981) Time Series.

Assuming that these underlying failure times are independent is attractive since it allows standard statistical tools for right-censored lifetime data to be used in the analysis. This paper proposes simple independence score tests for the validity of this assumption when parametric regression models are used to model the individual risks. The score tests are derived for the alternatives that specify that copulas are responsible for a possible dependency between competing risks. The test statistics are functions of the Cox and Snell residuals. A variance estimator is derived by writing the score function and the Fisher information matrix for the marginal models as stochastic integrals. A simulation study and a numerical example illustrate the methodology proposed in this paper. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.,Competing risks; Copulas; Hazard rate; Kendall's tau; Martingales; Weibull regression,,"Allison, P.D., (1995) Survival Analysis Using the SAS System: A Practical Guide, , SAS Institute Cary; E-Eaa, A., Kochar, S.C., Some tests for comparing cumulative incidence functions and cause-specific hazard rates (1994) J Am Stat Assoc, 89, pp. 994-999. , 427; Andersen, P.K., Borgan, O., Gill, R.D., Keiding, N., (1993) Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes, , Springer New York; Bienen, H.S., Van De Walle, N., (1991) Of Time and Power, , Stanford University Press Stanford; Carling, K., Jacobson, T., Modeling unemployment duration in a dependent competing risks framework: Identification and estimation (1995) Lifetime Data Anal, 1, pp. 111-122; Clayton, D.G., A model for association in bivariate life tables and its application in epidemiological studies of familial tendency in chronic disease incidence (1978) Biometrika, 65, pp. 141-152; Crowder, M., (2001) Classical Competing Risks, , Chapman & Hall/CRC Press London; Faraggi, D., Korn, E.L., Competing risks with frailty models when treatment affects only one failure type (1996) Biometrika, 83, pp. 467-471. , 2; Fermanian, J.D., Nonparametric estimation of competing risks models with covariates (2003) J Multivar Anal, 85, pp. 156-191; Fleming, T.R., Harrington, D.P., (1991) Counting Processes and Survival Analysis, , Wiley New York; Gasbarra, D., Karia, S.R., Analysis of competing risks by using Bayesian smoothing (2000) Scand J Stat, 27, pp. 605-617. , 4; Genest, C., Ghoudi, K., Rivest, L.-P., Comment on the paper by EW Valdez entitled ""understanding relationships using copulas"" (1998) North Am Actuar J, 2, pp. 143-149; Heckman, J.J., Honoré, B.E., The identifiability of the competing risks model (1989) Biometrika, 76, pp. 325-330. , 2; Kwan, P.H., Singh, H., On nonparametric estimation of the survival function with competing risks (2001) Scand J Stat, 28, pp. 715-724; Luo, X., Turnbull, B.W., Comparing two treatments with multiple competing risks endpoints (1999) Stat Sin, 9, pp. 985-998; Nelsen, R., An introduction to copula (1999) Lecture Notes in Statistics, 139. , Springer New York; Oakes, D., Wang, A., Copula model generated by Dabrowska's association measure (2003) Biometrika, 90, pp. 478-4813. , 2; Prentice, R.L., Kalbfleisch, J.D., Peterson, J.A.V., Flournoy, N., Farewell, V.T., Breslow, N.E., The analysis of failure times in the presence of competing risks (1978) Biometrics, 34, pp. 541-554. , 4; Rivest, L.-P., Wells, M.T., A martingale approach to the copula-graphic estimator for the survival function under dependent censoring (2001) J Multivar Anal, 79, pp. 138-155. , 1; Saïd, M., (2004) Méthodes Statistiques Pour Tester la Dépendance Entre les Variables Latentes Pour des Risques Concurrents, , PhD thesis, Département de Mathématiques et de Statistique, Université Laval; Saïd, M., Ghazzali, N., Rivest, L.-P., Moore, M., Froda, S., Léger, C., Score test for dependent censoring with survival data (2003) Mathematical Statistics and Applications: Festschrift for Constance Van Eeden, pp. 435-462. , Institute of Mathematical Statistics Hayward; Slud, E., Byar, D., How dependent causes of death can make risk factors appear protective (1988) Biometrics, 44, pp. 265-269. , 1; Tsiatis, A., A nonidentifiability aspect of the problem of competing risks (1975) Proc Nat Acad Sci United States Am, 72, pp. 20-22. , 1; Zheng, M., Klein, J.P., Estimates of marginal survival for dependent competing risks based on an assumed copula (1995) Biometrika, 82, pp. 127-138; Zheng, M., Klein, J.P., Jewell, N.P., Kimber, A.C., M-Lt, L., Whitmore, G.A., Identifiability and estimation of marginal survival functions for dependent competing risks assuming the copula is known (1996) Lifetime Data Models in Reliability and Survival Analysis, pp. 401-408. , Kluwer Academic Dordrecht",English,Article

Optimum conditions are obtained under which the proposed families of estimators have the minimum mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, the optimum values, depending upon population parameters, when replaced by sample values, yield the estimators having the minimum MSE of the optimum estimators. The estimators for MSEs of the suggested families are also given. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Auxiliary information; Bias; Mean squared error; Random non-response,,"Heitjan, D.F., Basu, S., Distinguishing missing at random and missing completely at random (1996) Am Stat, 50, pp. 207-213; Randles, R., On the asymptotic normality of statistics with estimated parameters (1982) Ann Stat, 10, pp. 462-474. , 2; Rao, J.N.K., Pereira, N.P., On double ratio estimators (1968) Sankhyā ser A, 30, pp. 83-90; Ray, S.K., Singh, R.K., Some estimators for the ratio and product of population parameters (1985) J Indian Soc Agric Stat, 37, pp. 1-10. , 1; Rubin, D.B., Inference and missing data (1976) Biometrika, 63, pp. 581-592. , 3; Shah, S.M., Shah, D.N., Ratio-cum-product estimator for estimating ratio (product) of two population parameters (1978) Sankhyā ser C, 40, pp. 156-166. , 2; Singh, H.P., Estimation of ratio, product and mean using auxiliary information in sample survey (1986) Aligarh J Stat, 6, pp. 32-44; Singh, H.P., A generalized class of estimators of ratio, product and mean using supplementary information on an auxiliary character in PPSWR sampling scheme (1986) Gujarat Stat Rev, 13, pp. 1-30. , 2; Singh, H.P., On the estimation of ratio and product of two finite population means (1988) Proc Nat Acad Sci India Sect A, 58, pp. 399-403. , III; Singh, H.P., Tracy, D.S., Estimation of population mean in presence of random non-response in sample surveys (2001) Statistica, 61, pp. 231-248; Singh, M.P., On the estimation of ratio and product of population parameters (1965) Sankhyā ser B, 27, pp. 321-328; Singh, M.P., Ratio cum product method of estimation (1967) Metrika, 12, pp. 34-43. , 1; Singh, S., Joarder, A.H., Estimation of finite population variance using random non-response in survey sampling (1998) Metrika, 47, pp. 241-249; Singh, S., Joarder, A.H., Tracy, D.S., Regression type estimators for random non-response in survey sampling (2000) Statistica, 60, pp. 39-44. , 1; Singh, S., Singh, R., On random non-response in unequal sampling (1979) Sankhyā, 41, pp. 27-37; Singh, S., Singh, R., On random non-response in double sampling with difference estimator (1985) Commun Stat Simul Comput, 14, pp. 747-757; Singh, V.K., Singh, H.P., Singh, H.P., Estimation of ratio and product of two finite population means in two-phase sampling (1994) J Stat Plan Inference, 41, pp. 163-171; Singh, V.K., Singh, H.P., Singh, H.P., Shukla, D., A general class of chain estimators for ratio and product of two means of a finite population (1994) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 23, pp. 1341-1355; Srivastava, S.K., A generalized estimator for the mean of a finite population using multiauxiliary information (1971) J Am Stat Assoc, 66, pp. 404-407; Srivastava, S.K., A class of estimators using auxiliary information in sample surveys (1980) Can J Stat, 8, pp. 253-254; Srivastava, S.K., Jhajj, H.S., A class of estimators of the population mean in survey sampling using auxiliary information (1981) Biometrika, 68, pp. 341-343; Srivastava, S.R., Srivastava, S.R., Khare, B.B., Chain ratio type estimators for ratio of two population means using auxiliary characters (1989) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 18, pp. 3917-3926. , 10; Toutenburg, H., Srivastava, V.K., Estimation of ratio of population means in survey sampling when some observations are missing (1998) Metrika, 48, pp. 177-187; Tracy, D.S., Osahan, S.S., Random non-response on study variable versus on study as well as auxiliary variables (1994) Statistica, 54, pp. 163-168. , 2; Tripathi, T.P., A general class of estimators for population ratio (1980) Sankhyā ser C, 42, pp. 63-75; Upadhyaya, L.N., Singh, H.P., A class of estimators using auxiliary information for estimating ratio of two finite population means (1985) Gujarat Stat Rev, 12, pp. 7-16. , 2; Upadhyaya, L.N., Singh, H.P., Vos, J.W.E., On the estimation of population means and ratios using supplementary information (1985) Stat Neerlandica, 39, pp. 309-318. , 3",English,Article

Wolfinger (1998, J Qual Technol 36:162-170) presented a simulation-based approach for determining Bayesian tolerance intervals in a balanced one-way random effects model. In this note the theory and results of Wolfinger are extended to the balanced two-factor nested random effects model. The example illustrates the flexibility and unique features of the Bayesian simulation method for the construction of tolerance intervals. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayesian procedure; Monte Carlo simulation; Predictive density; Random effects; Tolerance intervals,,"Bagui, S., Bhaumik, D.K., Parnes, M., One-sided tolerance limit for unbalanced m-way random effects ANOVA models (1996) J Appl Stat Sci, 3, pp. 135-148; Berger, J.O., Bernardo, J.M., On the development of reference priors (with discussion) (1992) Bayesian Statistics, 4, pp. 35-60. , Bernardo JM, Berger JO, Dawid AP, Smith AFM (eds).

De Santis F.,Alternative Bayes factors: Sample size determination and discriminatory power assessment,2007,Test,504,522,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-36448966782&partnerID=40&md5=cc7a0c9f4bc930a55b8230d25c65cf52,"Alternative Bayes factors are families of methods used for hypothesis testing and model selection when sensitivity to priors is a concern and also when prior information is weak or lacking. This paper deals with two related problems that arise in the practical use of these model choice criteria: sample size determination and evaluation of discriminatory power. We propose a pre-experimental approach to cope with both these issues. Specifically, extending the evidential approach of Royall (J Am Stat Assoc 95(451):760-780, 2000) and following De Santis (J Stat Plan Inference 124(1):121-144, 2004), we propose a criterion for sample size choice based on the predictive probability of observing decisive and correct evidence. The basic idea is to select the minimal sample size that guarantees a sufficiently high pre-experimental probability that an alternative Bayes factor provides strong evidence in favor of the true hypothesis. It is also argued that a predictive analysis is a natural approach to the measurement of discriminatory power of alternative Bayes factors. The necessity of measuring discrimination ability depends on the fact that alternative Bayes factors are, in general, less sensitive to prior specifications than ordinary Bayes factors and that this gain in robustness corresponds to a reduced discriminative power. Finally, implementation of the predictive approach with improper priors is discussed and possible strategies are proposed. © 2007 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Bayes factors; Default Bayes factors; Discriminatory power; Experimental design; Fractional Bayes factors; Intrinsic Bayes factors; Sample size; Statistical evidence,,"Adcock, C.J., Sample size determination: A review (1997) J Roy Stat Soc ser D Stat, 46, pp. 261-283; Bayarri, M.J., Mayoral, A.M., Bayesian analysis and design for comparison of effect-sizes (2002) J Stat Plan Inference, 103, pp. 225-243; Berger, J.O., Boukai, B., Wang, Y., Unified frequentist and Bayesian testing of a precise hypothesis (1997) Stat Sci, 12, pp. 133-160. , 3; Berger, J.O., Mortera, J., Default Bayes factors for one-sided hypothesis testing (1999) J Am Stat Assoc, 94, pp. 542-554; Berger, J.O., Pericchi, L.R., The intrinsic Bayes factor for model selection and prediction (1996) J Am Stat Assoc, 91, pp. 109-122; Berger, J.O., Pericchi, L.R., Objective Bayesian methods for model selection: Introduction and comparison (2001) IMS Lecture Notes-monograph Series, 38. , Lahiri P (ed) Model selection.

We construct estimators of these two parameters and discuss statistical properties of this important model: the rate of the Fisher information and a testing procedure to check the multifractal feature of an observed noisy signal. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Empirical estimators; Multifractal analysis; Wavelet bases,,"Arneodo, A., Bacry, E., Jaffard, S., Muzy, J.F., Singularity spectrum of multifractal functions involving oscillating singularities (1998) J Fourier Anal Appl, 4 (2), pp. 159-174; Arneodo, A., Bacry, E., Jaffard, S., Muzy, J.F., Oscillating singularities and fractal functions (1999) Spline functions and the theory of wavelets, Montreal, 1996.

Relying on concepts of regular variation theory, it investigates the asymptotic properties of Hasofer and Wang's test statistic based on the k upper extremes taken from a sample of size n, when k behaves as an intermediate sequence k n rather than remaining fixed while the sample size increases. In the process a Greenwood type test statistic is proposed which turns out to be useful in discriminating heavy-tailed distributions. The finite sample behavior of both testing procedures is evaluated in the light of a simulation study. The testing procedures are then applied to three real data sets. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Heavy-tailed distribution; Hypothesis testing; Max-domain of attraction; Regular variation theory,,"Balkema, A.A., de Haan, L., Residual life time at great age (1974) Ann Probab, 2, pp. 792-804; Beirlant, J., Goegebeur, Y., Segers, J., Teugels, J., (2004) Statistics of extremes: Theory and applications, , Wiley, London; Castillo, E., Galambos, J., Sarabia, J.M., The selection of the domain of attraction of an extreme value distribution from a set of data (1989) Lecture notes in statistics, 51, pp. 181-190. , Hüsler J, Reiss R-D eds, Springer, Berlin, pp; Castillo, E., Hadi, A.S., Fitting the generalized Pareto distribution to data (1997) J Am Stat Assoc, 92, pp. 1609-1620; Castillo, E., Hadi, A.S., Balakrishnan, N., Sarabia, J.M., (2005) Extreme value and related models with applications in engineering and science, , Wiley, Hoboken; de Haan, L., Slow variation and characterization of domains of attraction (1984) Statistical extremes and applications, pp. 31-48. , de Oliveira JT ed, Reidel, Dordrecht, pp; de Haan, L., Stadtmüller, U., Generalized regular variation of second order (1996) J Aust Math Soc Ser A, 61, pp. 381-395; de Zea Bermudez, P., Amaral Turkman, M.A., A predictive approach to tail probability estimation (2001) Extremes, 4, pp. 295-314; de Zea Bermudez, P., Amaral Turkman, M.A., Bayesian approach to parameter estimation of the generalized Pareto distribution (2003) Test, 12 (1), pp. 259-277; Draisma, G., de Haan, L., Peng, L., Pereira, T.T., A bootstrap-based method to achieve optimality in estimation the extreme-value index (1999) Extremes, 2 (4), pp. 367-404; Fraga Alves, M.I., Gomes, M.I., Statistical choice of extreme value domains of attraction - a comparative analysis (1996) Commun Stat Theory Methods, 4 (25), pp. 789-811; Gnedenko, B.V., Sur la distribution limite du terme maximum d'une série aléatoire (1943) Ann Math, 44, pp. 423-453; Greenwood, M., The statistical study of infectious diseases (1946) J Roy Stat Soc Ser A, 109, pp. 85-109; Hasofer, A.M., Wang, Z., A test for extreme value domain of attraction (1992) J Am Stat Assoc, 87, pp. 171-177; Hsing, T., A case study of ozone pollution with XTREMES (1997) Statistical analysis of extreme values, pp. 251-256. , Reiss R-D, Thomas M eds, Birkhäuser, Basel, pp; Marohn, F., An adaptive test for Gumbel domain of attraction (1998) Scand J Stat, 25, pp. 311-324; Marohn, F., Testing the Gumbel hypothesis via the POT-method (1998) Extremes, 1 (2), pp. 191-213; Matthys, G., Beirlant, J., (2001) Extreme quantile estimation for heavy-tailed distributions, , www.kuleuven.ac.be/ucs/research/publi.htm, Working paper, University Center of Statistics, Katholieke University Leuven.

In many practical surveys it was observed that a character considered to be stigmatizing by a group of respondents did not appear to be such to another group, and direct responses (DR's) to divulge its true characteristics were offered. Chaudhuri and Mukerjee (Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull 34:225-229, 1985; Randomized response: theory and techniques. Dekker, New York, 1988) introduced the concept of optional RR (ORR) to accommodate direct responses offered by such respondents. Since unequal probability stratified sampling is followed in large-scale socio-economic surveys, it is necessary to develop RR procedures for such complex surveys. Kuk's method is extended to varying probability stratified sampling when RR's as well as DR's are permitted. A numerical study comparing the performance of alternative procedures is also reported. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Compulsory randomized response; Direct response; Kuk's method; Stratified unequal probability sampling,,"Chaudhuri, A., Estimating sensitive proportions from unequal probability sample using randomized responses (2001) Pak J Stat, 17 (3), pp. 259-270; Chaudhuri, A., Using randomized response from a complex survey to estimate a sensitive proportion in a dichotomous finite population (2001) J Stat Plan Inference, 94, pp. 37-42; Chaudhuri, A., Estimating sensitive proportions from randomized responses in unequal probability sampling (2002) Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull, 52 (205-208), pp. 315-322; Chaudhuri, A., Mukerjee, R., Optionally randomized response techniques (1985) Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull, 34, pp. 225-229; Chaudhuri, A., Mukerjee, R., (1988) Randomized response: Theory and techniques, , Dekker, New York; Chaudhuri, A., Saha, A., Optional versus compulsory randomized response techniques in complex survey (2005) J Stat Plan Inference, 135, pp. 516-527; Christofides, T.C., Randomized response in stratified sampling (2005) J Stat Plan Inference, 128 (1), pp. 303-310; Kim, J.M., Elam, M.E., A two-stage stratified Warner's randomized response model using optimal allocation (2005) Metrika, 61 (1), pp. 1-7; Kim, J.M., Warde, W.D., A stratified Warner's randomized response model (2004) J Stat Plan Inference, 120, pp. 155-165; Kim, J.M., Warde, W.D., A mixed randomized response model (2005) J Stat Plan Inference, 133 (1), pp. 211-221; Kuk, A.Y.C., Asking sensitive questions indirectly (1990) Biometrika, 77, pp. 436-438; Raj, D., (1968) Sampling theory, , Mc-Graw-Hill, New York; Rao, J.N.K., Unbiased variance estimation for multi-stage designs (1975) Sankhyā Ser, 37, pp. 133-139. , C; Rao, J.N.K., Hartley, H.O., Cochran, W.G., On a simple procedure of unequal probability sampling without replacement (1962) J Roy Stat Soc Ser B, 24, pp. 482-491; Saha, A., On efficacies of Dalenius-Vitale technique with compulsory versus optional randomized responses from complex surveys (2004) Calcutta Stat Assoc Bull, 54, pp. 223-230; Warner, S.L., Randomized response: A survey technique for eliminating evasive answer bias (1965) J Am Stat Assoc, 60, pp. 63-69",English,Article

This estimate, although consistent, can display pronounced bias in small to moderately large samples, as shown by Monte Carlo simulations here. In this paper, we obtain a simple matrix formula for the bias of order n-2 of this estimate, where n is the sample size, and define a third-order bias-corrected estimate in this class of models, which displays much smaller bias in small samples. In particular, some Monte Carlo simulations show that our new estimate can deliver substantial improvements in terms of bias and mean squared errors over the usual maximum likelihood estimate and Cordeiro and McCullagh's estimate. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Bias correction; Canonical model; Cumulant; Gamma model; Generalized linear model; Maximum likelihood estimate; Mean squared error,,"Bowman KO, Shenton LR (1965) Biases and covariances of maximum likelihood estimators.

We prove the strong consistency of posterior distribution under a fairly general class of priors. This entails, in particular, that the Bayes estimate of the level set is consistent in terms of the Lebesgue measure of the symmetric difference. The considered priors put mass on piecewise-constant densities. The pieces on which the densities are constant are Voronoi tiles generated by a spatial point process. Using conditions similar to those considered in the density framework, we also obtain the consistency of the Bayesian level set estimates in the regression model. We present a simulation study using a special prior in the framework of density level set estimation. This allows us to visualise the numerical performances of the Bayesian estimate and to compare them to a plug-in level set estimate. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Bayesian nonparametric estimation; Consistency; Level sets; Reversible jump MCMC; Spatial point process; Voronoi tessellation,,"Arjas, E., Gasbarra, D., Nonparametric Bayesian inference from right censored survival data, using the Gibbs sampler (1994) Stat Sin, 4, pp. 505-524; Arjas, E., Heikkinen, J., An algorithm for nonparametric Bayesian estimation of a Poisson intensity (1997) Comput Stat, 12, pp. 385-402; Arjas, E., Heikkinen, J., Non-parametric Bayesian estimation of a spatial Poisson intensity (1998) Scand J Stat, 25, pp. 435-450; Arjas, E., Heikkinen, J., Modeling a Poisson forest in variable elevations: A nonparametric Bayesian approach (1999) Biometrics, 55, pp. 738-745; Baillo, A., Cuesta-Albertos, J.A., Cuevas, A., Convergence rates in nonparametric estimation of level sets (2001) Stat Probab Lett, 53, pp. 27-35; Barron, A., Schervish, M.J., Wasserman, L., The consistency of posterior distribution in nonparametric problems (1999) Ann Stat, 27, pp. 536-561; Byers, S.D., Raftery, A.E., Bayesian estimation and segmentation of spatial point processes using Voronoi tilings (2002) Spatial Cluster Modelling, , Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Press, A.

Several methods based on nonparametric estimators of the regression function are described. In this setting, the distribution of the test statistic is frequently unknown or difficult to compute, so an approximate test based on the asymptotic distribution of the statistic can be considered. Nevertheless, the asymptotic properties of the methods proposed in this work have been obtained under independence of the observations, and just one of these methods was studied in a context of dependence as reported by Vilar-Fernández and González-Manteiga (Statistics 58(2):81-99, 2003). In addition, the distribution of these test statistics converges to the limit distribution with convergence rates usually rather slow, so that the approximations obtained for reasonable sample sizes are not satisfactory. For these reasons, many authors have suggested the use of bootstrap algorithms as an alternative approach. Our main concern is to compare the behavior of three bootstrap procedures that take into account the dependence assumption of the observations when they are used to approximate the distribution of the test statistics considered. A broad simulation study is carried out to observe the finite sample performance of the analyzed bootstrap tests. © Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa 2007.",Dependent data; Hypothesis testing; Nonparametric estimators; Regression models,,"Berkowitz, J., Kilian, L., Recent developments in bootstrapping time series (2000) Econ Rev, 19, pp. 1-48; Cao, R., An overview of bootstrap methods for estimating and predicting in time series (1999) Test, 8 (1), pp. 95-116; Davidson, R., MacKinnon, J.G., Graphical methods for investigating the size and power of hypothesis tests (1986) Manch Sch, 66, pp. 1-26; Delgado, M.A., Testing the equality of non-parametric regression curves (1993) Stat Probab Lett, 17, pp. 199-204; Delicado, P., Placencia, I., Comparing empirical distributions of p-values from simulations (2001) Commun Stat Simul Comput, 30 (2), pp. 403-422; Dette, H., Neumeyer, N., Nonparametric analysis of covariance (2001) Ann Stat, 29 (5), pp. 1361-1400; Fan, J., Gijbels, I., (1996) Local Polynomial Modelling and Its Applications, , Chapman & Hall, London; Hall, P., Hart, J.D., Bootstrap test for difference between means in nonparametric regression (1990) J am Stat Assoc, 412 (85), pp. 1039-1049; Hall, P., Huber, C., Speckman, P.L., Covariate-matched one-sided tests for the difference between functional means (1997) J am Stat Assoc, 439 (92), pp. 1074-1083; Hall, P., Marron, J.S., On variance estimation in nonparametric regression (1990) Biometrika, 77, pp. 415-419; Härdle, W., Horowitz, J., Kreiss, J.P., Bootstrap methods for time series (2003) Int Stat Rev, 71 (2), pp. 435-460; Härdle, W., Mammen, E., Comparing nonparametric versus parametric regression fits (1993) Ann Stat, 21, pp. 1926-1947; Härdle, W., Marron, J.S., Semiparametric comparison of regression curves (1990) Ann Stat, 18, pp. 63-89; King, E.C., Hart, J.D., Wehrly, T.E., Testing the equality of two regression curves using linear smoothers (1991) Stat Probab Lett, 12 (3), pp. 239-247; Koul, H.L., Schick, A., Testing for the equality of two nonparametric regression curves (1997) J Stat Plan Inference, 65, pp. 293-314; Kulasekera, K.B., Comparison of regression curves using quasi-residuals (1995) J am Stat Assoc, 431 (90), pp. 1085-1093; Kulasekera, K.B., Wang, J., Smoothing parameter selection for power optimality in testing of regression curves (1997) J am Stat Assoc, 438 (92), pp. 500-511; Kulasekera, K.B., Wang, J., Bandwidth selection for power optimality in a test of equality of regression curves (1998) Stat Probab Lett, 37, pp. 287-293; Künsch, H.R., The jackknife and the bootstrap for general stationary observations (1989) Ann Stat, 17, pp. 1217-1241; Li, H., Maddala, G., Moving blocks jackknife and bootstrap capture weak dependence (1992) Exploring the Limits of Bootstrap, pp. 225-248. , R.

It considers the family of distributions arising from the cause-specific model as reported by Chiang (Introduction to stochastic processes in biostatistics. Wiley, New York, 1968) upon which change-points are added to accommodate possible distributional heterogeneity. Model departure, due to misspecification of change-points associated with either the overall survival distribution or cause-specific probabilities, is quantified in terms of a sequence of cumulative-sum statistics between each pair of adjacent change-points assumed. When assessing the asymptotic behavior of each sequence of cumulative-sum statistics using its posterior predictive p-values, see Rubin (Ann Stat 12:1151-1172, 1984) and partial posterior predictive p-values as reported by Bayarri and Berger (J Am Stat Assoc 95:1127-1142, 2000), we show that both types of p-values attain their greatest departure from 0.5 at the change-point that is missed in the assumed model, from which a diagnostic procedure is formalized.

All this is overlaid with a high level of noise and there are dependencies between the different items measured. Current monitoring systems tend to deliver too many false warnings which reduces their acceptability by medical staff. The challenge is to develop a method which allows a fast and reliable denoising of the data and which can separate artefacts from clinical relevant structural changes in the patients condition (Estadistica 53 (2001) 259). A simple median filter works well as long as there is no substantial trend in the data but improvements may be possible by approximating the data by a local linear trend. As a first step in this programme, the paper examines the relative merits of the L1 regression, the repeated median (Biometrika 68 (1982) 242) and the least median of squares (Bull. Internat.

It discusses schemes that can potentially improve the Lagrangean relaxation bound, and describes several applications of Lagrangean relaxation, which demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, and permit either the computation of strong bounds on the optimal value of the MIP problem, or the use of a Lagrangean heuristic, possibly followed by an iterative improvement heuristic.

We consider the Kriged Kalman filter (KKF), a powerful modelling strategy which combines the two wellestablished approaches of (a) Kriging, in the field of spatial statistics, and (b) the Kalman filter, in general state space formulations of multivariate time series analysis. We give a brief introduction to the model and describe its various properties, and highlight that the model allows prediction in time as well as in space, simultaneously. Some special cases of the time series model are considered. We give some procedures to implement the model, also illustrated through a practical example.

In order to analyze the influence of this prior distribution on the solution of the problem, Bernardo (1981) proposed to compare the results with those that one would obtain by using that prior distribution which maximizes the useful experimental information, thus introducing the concept of reference decision. This definition is too involved for most of the problems usually found in practice. Here we analyze situations in which it is possible to simplify the definition of the reference decision, and we provide conditions guaranteeing the existence of such decisions. © 1998 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.","AMS subject classification: Primary 62C05, Secondary 62F15; Information measures; Non-Informative Priors; Reference Decisions; Uncertainty Functions; Weak Topology",,,English,Article

A production planning problem with uncertainty in demand is used as a test case, but the methodology presented here is applicable to other types of problems as well. In these models, uncertainty in demand is characterized via scenarios. Solutions are obtained for each scenario and then these individual scenario solutions are aggregated to yield an implementable non-anticipative policy. Such an approach makes it possible to model correlated and nonstationary demand as well as a variety of recourse decision types. For computational purposes, two alternative representations are proposed. A compact approach that is suitable for the Simplex method and a splitting variable approach that is suitable for the Interior Point Methods. A crash procedure that generates an advanced starting solution for the Simplex method is developed. Computational results are reported with both the representations. Although some of the models presented here are very large (over 25000 constraints and 75000 variables), our computational experience with these problems is quite encouraging. © 1995 Sociedad de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",compact representation; nonanticipativity; production planning; scenario tree; splitting variable representation,,"Alvarez, M., Escudero, L.F., de la Fuente, J.L., García, C., Prieto, F.J., Network planning under uncertainty with an application to hydropower generation (1994) TOP, 2, pp. 25-58; Birge, J.B., Decomposition and Partitioning Methods for Multistage Stochastic Linear Programs (1985) Operations Research, 33, pp. 989-1007; Birge, J.B., An L-Shaped method computer code for multi-stage stochastic linear programs (1988) Numerical techniques for stochastic optimization, pp. 255-266. , Y., Ermoliev, R.J.-B., Wets, Springer-Verlag, Berlin; Bitran, G., Yanesse, H., Deterministic approximations to stochastic production planning problems (1984) Operations Research, 32, pp. 999-1018; Bitran, G., Sarkar, S., On upper bounds of sequential stochastic production planning problems (1988) European J. of Operational Research, 34, pp. 191-207; Bjornestad, S., Hallfjord, A., Joernsten, K.O., (1989) Discrete Optimization under uncertainty: The scenario and policy aggregation technique, , working paper 89/06, Chr.

That is, the problem of finding the energy production of every power plant (hydro or thermal) in every subperiod of a given planning period, so that the customer load is supplied at minimum cost. The planning horizon is typically one to two months and the first week of this planning period is modeled in detail. The solution method proposed decomposes the problem in two subproblems corresponding to the hydro and thermal subsystems. These two subproblems are coordinated using a coordinating function for every subperiod. The coordinating function of a given subperiod expresses total production cost in that subperiod as a function of the total hydro production in that subperiod. The decomposition proposed makes it possible to use specialized algorithms to solve the hydro and thermal subproblems. This results in a very efficient computational procedure. From an experimental point of view the coordinating mechanism is robust. A case study is provided. It considers 61 thermal plants, a hydro system including 8 cascaded hydro plants and a 48 subperiods planning period. © 1994 Sociedad Española de Estadística e Investigación Operativa.",Decomposition; Hydro Scheduling; Linear Programming; Relaxation; Short-Term Hydro-Thermal Coordination; Unit Commitment,,,English,Article

Such a group will be considered as closed. We approach in the first part thereof the problem of estimating the probability that from these N elements, in a certain steta at the origin of the system, would exist in a certain x moment number of elements having moved to two other stades whilst the other will remain at the starting state. Every necessary assumptions are established and it is put the equation of the system. To get its solution we will use the generatrix function arriving at the fact that the latter will correspond to a multinomial distribution. The average means of this distribution will depend on the elebentary probabilities of a state change. Considering that the assumtions must be made on the latter, owing to have got the essence of the phenomenon in study in its most elementary appearance. Also the marginal process will be establisted in the event of a sole elimination cause. In the second part an interpretation will be given within the dynamic statistics, as it will be dealt with a stochastic process the graphical representation of which would need a space of three dimensions. In the third part some actuarial interpretations are given both of the marginal process and multinomial one. © 1957 Springer.",,,,Spanish,Article

The biometric models are obtained through the study of the stocastic proceeding of the death. The valuation of the Makeham and Lazarus models is made through its planning in a functional orthogonal scope which permits to use lineal estimation technics, obtaining in this manner the reliance intervals of the ccrrespondent coefficients. It is ended applying the attained issues to the demonstration of the theorems of consistency of the life insurance mathematics. © 1956 Springer.",,,,Spanish,Article
