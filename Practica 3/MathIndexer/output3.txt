A direct time integration method is presented for the solution of systems of first order ordinary differential
equations, which represent semi-discrete diffusion equations. The proposed method is based on the principle of
the analog equation, which converts the N coupled equations into a set of N single term uncoupled first order
ordinary differential equations under fictitious sources. The solution is obtained from the integral representa-
tion of the solution of the substitute single term equations. The stability and convergence of the numerical
scheme is proved. The method is simple to implement. It is self-starting, unconditionally stable, accurate, while
it does not exhibit numerical damping. The stability does not demand symmetrical and positive definite
coefficient matrices. This is an important advantage, since the scheme can solve semi-discrete diffusion
equations resulting frommethods that do not produce symmetrical matrices, e.g. the boundary element method.
The method applies also to equations with variable coefficients as well as to nonlinear ones. It performs well
when long time durations are considered and it can be used as a practical method for integration of stiff
parabolic equations in cases where widely used methods may fail. Numerical examples, including linear as well
as non linear systems, are treated by the proposed method and its efficiency and accuracy are demonstrated.

1. Introduction

The initial value problem for the linear semi-discrete diffusion
equation is stated as

t t T TCu Ku ṗ + = ( ), ∈ [0, ], > 0 (1)

u u(0) = 0 (2)

where tu u= ( ) represents the vector of the unknown functions, tp( ) the
external source vector, and u0 a given vector.

Eq. (1) represents the semi-discrete parabolic equations, that is,
parabolic equations of which the space variables have been discretized
and the time variable is left continuous. The matrices C and K may be
symmetrical or not, depending on the method used for the spatial
discretization.

The most well known and commonly used methods for solving Eq.
(1) are members of the generalized trapezoidal family or α − family of
methods, in which the time derivative is approximated by a weighted
average of the field function at two consecutive time steps. Some well
known members are identified from the value of the parameter α. Thus
we have, the forward differences or forward Euler (α = 0), the
trapezoidal rule or Crank-Nicolson (α = 1/2), and backward difference
or backward Euler (α = 1). The α − family of approximations is
unconditionally stable for α ≥ 1/2, while for α < 1/2 the methods are

stable if the condition Δt Δt a λ< ≡ 2/(1 − 2 )cr max , where λmax is the
largest eigenvalue of the matrix C K−1 , is satisfied with C K, being
symmetrical and positive definite [1,2].

In this paper a new direct time integration method is presented for
the numerical solution of the initial value problem (1) and (2). The
proposed method is based on the principle of the analog equation [3],
which converts the N coupled equations into a set of N single term
uncoupled first order ordinary differential equations under fictitious
sources, unknown in the first instance. The fictitious sources are
established from the integral representation of the solution of the
substitute single term equations. The solution procedure is analogous
to that presented in [4]. But in this case the substitute equation is of the
first order and the unknown fictitious source represents the first
derivative. The stability is proved and the convergence is shown
through well corroborated numerical results. The method is simple to
implement. It is self starting, unconditionally stable and accurate. The
stability does not demand symmetrical and positive definite coefficient
matricesC K, as the widely used methods, but can solve equations with
non-symmetrical matrices provided that the eigenvalues of the matrix
C K−1 are nonnegative or have nonnegative real part for the complex
eigenvalues. This is an important advantage, since the scheme can
solve semi-discrete diffusion equations resulting from methods that do
not produce symmetrical matrices, e.g. the boundary element method.

Moreover, the method performs well when long time durations are
considered as it conserves energy and, thus, it can be used as a practical
method for integration of the parabolic equations in cases where widely
used methods do not apply or may fail. It applies also to the case of
time dependent coefficient matrices, i.e., t tC K( ), ( ), as well as for
nonlinear equations. The method is illustrated by solving several
equations, including linear as well as non linear systems. The obtained
results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from exact
solutions.

2. The linear system

2.1. The AEM solution

We illustrate the AEM (Analog Equation Method) with the linear
one-degree-of-freedom system

cu ku p t c k̇ + = ( ), , > 0 (3)

u u(0) = 0 (4)

Let u u t= ( ) be the sought solution. Then, if the operator d dt/ is
applied to it, yields

u q ṫ = ( ) (5)

where q t( ) is a fictitious source, unknown in the first instance. Eq. (5)
is the analog of Eq. (3) [3]. It indicates that the solution of Eq. (3) can
be obtained by solving Eq. (5) under the initial condition (4), if q t( ) is
first established. This is implemented as following.

Taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (5) we obtain

sU s u Q s( ) − (0) = ( )

or

U s
s
u

s
Q s( ) = 1 (0) + 1 ( )

(6)

whereU s Q s( ), ( ) are the Laplace transforms of u t q t( ), ( ). The inverse
Laplace transform of expression (6) yields the solution of Eq. (5) in
integral form

∫u t u q τ dτ( ) = (0) + ( )
t

0 (7)

Thus the initial value problem of Eqs. (3) and (4) is transformed
into an equivalent Volterra integral equation for q t( ), Eq. (7).

Eq. (7) is solved numerically within a time interval T[0, ]. Following
a procedure analogous to that presented in [4], the interval T[0, ] is
divided into N equal intervals t hΔ = , h T N= / (Fig. 1), in which q t( ) is
assumed to vary according to a certain law, e.g. constant, linear etc.

Hence, Eq. (7) at instant t nh= can be written as

∫ ∫ ∫

2.2. Solution procedure for constant fictitious source q t( )

Without excluding higher order variation laws for q t( ), we assume
that it is constant within the integration interval r h rh[( − 1) , ] and
equal to the mean value

Substituting Eq. (11) into Eq. (10) gives

Moreover, Eq. (3) at time t nh= is written as

cq ku p+ =n n n (13)

The coefficient matrix in Eq. (14) is not ill-conditioned for sufficient

small h and the system can be solved successively for n = 1, 2, … to
yield the solution un and its derivative u q̇ =n n at instant t nh T= ≤ . For
n = 1, the value q0 appears in the right hand side of Eq. (14). This
quantity can be readily obtained from Eq. (3) for t = 0. This yields

q p ku c= ( − )/0 0 0 (15)

Eq. (14) can be also written in matrix form

We can readily extend the previous procedure to the problem (1)

differential equations. Obviously, the analog equations corresponding
to Eq. (5) constitute the set of the L uncoupled equations

tu q̇ = ( ) (18)

where tu q̇ , ( ) are L × 1 vectors. Thus, the numerical scheme for the
solution becomes

We observe that the last of Eq. (23) gives the solution vector Un at
instant t nh=n using only the known vector U0 at t = 0. The matrix A
and the vector b are computed only once.

The matrix A is the amplification matrix. In order that the solution
is stable, An must be bounded. This is true if the spectral radius ρ A( )
satisfies the condition

ρ λA( ) = max( ) ≤ 1i (24)

where λi are the eigenvalues of A. If ρ A( ) < 1 the method is strongly
stable. The condition (24) is satisfied, if all eigenvalues of the matrix
K C Kˆ = −1 are nonnegative or have nonnegative real part for complex
eigenvalues. This is proved in what follows.

Proof.

First we write Eq.(1) as

tu Ku C p K C K̇ + ˆ = ( ), ˆ =−1 −1 (25)

Thus the matrix A defined by Eq. (20b) becomes

a) For real λ̂i, if λ̂ ≥ 0i
b) For complex λ a iβˆ = +i i i, if a ≥ 0i

Hence the stability criterion can be stated as:
The proposed numerical scheme is stable, that is the stability

condition (24) is satisfied, if the eigenvalues of the matrix K C Kˆ = −1
are nonnegative or have nonnegative real part for complex eigenva-
lues.

2.4. Error analysis and convergence

The error is due to the approximation of the integrand in the
integral of Eq. (8) in the r integration interval r h rh[( − 1) , ]

Hence the error is

Expanding f τ( ) in Taylor series at τ = 0 and evaluating the integral
of f τ f τ( ) − ( )∼ over the interval t t[ , ]0 1 we find

2.5. Numerical examples

Matlab codes, based on the developed numerical schemes have
been written and various example problems have been solved. Note
that the exact solutions, where no reference is made, have been
obtained using the inverse method presented by Katsikadelis [4].
According to this method, a solution is assumed, which yields the
corresponding source after inserting it in the equation.

Example 1. One-degree of freedom system.
Eq. (1) has been solved with data: c = 5, k = 50,

p t cω ωt k ωt( ) = − sin + cos , u = 10 , ω = 2. Eq. (1) admits an exact
solution u ωt= cosex . Fig. 2 shows the computed solution as

validate the convergence of the numerical scheme. Moreover, Fig. 4
verifies that the convergence is of O h( )2 . Fig. 5 shows the solution for
long duration t h(0 ≤ ≤ 50000, = 0.01). We observe that the scheme
remains stable and the error within the same bounds. Finally, Fig. 6
shows that the quantity u cu u ku u p ṫ + = ( )T T T , that is the total “work”
remains unchanged during the whole procedure, which means that the
scheme does not exhibit numerical damping.

The adopted numerical values are: a b= = 3, k k= = 1.25x y , c = 1,
ρ = 1, and u = 300 .

The solution was computed using the AEM BEM [7] with N = 200
constant boundary elements, L = 121 domain nodal points distributed
uniformly, and shape parameter of the multiquadrics c = 0.2. This
solution method produces, semi-discrete equations of the form (1) with
nonsymmetrical and non-positive definite matrices C K, with dimen-
sions 121 × 121, whereas the matrix C K−1 satisfies the stability criter-
ion.

error u t u t u t[ (1.5, 1.5; ) − (1.5, 1.5; )]/ (1.5, 1.5; )ex ex with Δt = 0.005.

3. Linear equation with variable coefficients

So far we have developed the method for the solution of Eq. (1) with
constant coefficients. Obviously, if the coefficients c and k in Eq.(3) are
functions of the independent variable t , i.e., c t k t( ), ( ), the previously
described solution procedure remains the same except that the
elements c k, in the first row of the coefficient matrix in the left hand
side of Eq. (14) depend on time. Therefore, this coefficient matrix in the
respective solution algorithm must be reevaluated in each step. In the
following, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated by solving an
equation with variable coefficients.

Example 5. Variable coefficients.
We consider the initial value problem

t u t u p t u(5 + ) ̇ + (1 + ) = ( ), = 12 0 (57)

Eq. (57) for p t t t t t t t( ) = [(0.5 − 0.1 + )cos − (5 + )sin ]exp(−0.1 )2
admits an exact solution u t e t( ) = cosex t−0.1 . The computed solution
for T = 30 and h = 0.01 is shown in Fig. 13 as compared with the exact
one.

4. Nonlinear equations

The solution procedure developed previously for the linear equa-
tions can be straightforwardly extended to nonlinear equations.

The nonlinear initial value problem for multi-degree of freedom
systems is described as

tCu F u ṗ + ( ) = ( ) (58)

u u(0) = 0 (59)

where C is L L× known coefficient matrix with Cdet( ) ≠ 0; F u( ) is an
L × 1 vector, whose elements are nonlinear functions of the compo-
nents of u; tp( ) is the external source vector and u0 a given constant
vector.

The solution procedure is similar to that for the linear systems.
Thus, Eq. (58) for t = 0 gives the vector

q C p F u q u= [ − ( )], = ̇0 −1 0 0 0 (60)

Subsequently, we apply Eq. (58) for t t= n

Cq F u p+ ( ) =n n n (61)

Apparently, Eq. (12) is valid in this case, too. Thus we may write

h hu u q q= +
2

+
2n n n n−1 −1 (62)

Eqs. (61) and (62) are combined and solved for q u,n n with
n = 1, 2, …. The solution can be obtained using an iterative procedure
in each step. A simple procedure is to substitute Eq. (62) into Eq. (61).
This yields a nonlinear equation for qn, which is solved by employing
any ready-to-use subroutine for nonlinear algebraic equations. In our

examples the functions fsolve of Matlab or the subroutine NEQNF of
the IMSL have been employed to obtain the numerical results.

Example 6. Nonlinear one-degree of freedom system.

In this example we consider the transient heat conduction in a

plane body with temperature dependent conductivity k k βu= (1 + )0 .
The temperature distribution u tx( , ) at time t , when the temperature on
the boundary is kept zero, is described by the following initial boundary

[7] with N = 200 constant boundary elements, L = 129 domain nodal
points uniformly distributed, and shape parameter of the multiquadrics
c = 0.1. This solution method produces, a system of 129 semi-discrete
equations of the form (58), which are solved using the procedure
described in Section 4. Fig. 16 shows the time variation of the
computed temperature u and its derivatives u u, , ,x xx at point (0, 0)

relative errors for Δt = 0.001.

the concentrations of the three involved chemical species and k k k, ,1 2 3
are the rate constants.

This problem, known as ROBER problem, is very popular in
numerical studies and it is often used as a benchmark problem to test

the efficiency of stiff numerical integrators. The numerical values of the
rate constants used in the test problem are k k= 0, 04, = 3 × 10 ,1 2 7
k = 103 4 . The large difference among the reaction rate constants is the
reason for stiffness. It was observed that many integration codes,
though for small intervals ( t0 ≤ ≤ 40) perform well, fail if t becomes
very large. In this case, u2 may accidentally become negative, and then
tends to −∞, causing overflow [9]. A Matlab code has been written

5. Conclusions

A direct time integration method has been developed for the
numerical solution of first order linear and nonlinear parabolic
differential equations. The developed numerical scheme is applied to
the solution of the semi-discrete equations arising in diffusion pro-
blems after spatial discretization using modern computational meth-
ods. Contrary to the widely used methods, the stability of the scheme
does not demand symmetrical and positive definite coefficient matrices
C K, . Thus, it can solve equations with nonsymmetrical and non-
positive definite matrices provided that the eigenvalues of the matrix
C K−1 are nonnegative or have nonnegative real part for the complex

eigenvalues. This is an important advantage, since the scheme can
solve semi-discrete diffusion equations resulting from methods that do
not produce symmetrical matrices, e.g. the boundary element method.
It applies also to equations with time dependent coefficient matrices,
i.e. variable coefficients. The method is simple to implement. It is self-
starting, unconditionally stable, second order accurate and does not
exhibit numerical damping. It performs well when long time durations
are considered. It can be used as a practical method for integration of
stiff diffusion equations in cases where widely used time integration
procedures fail. Besides, the present paper highlights the capability of
the AEM to solve differential equations of any order. The efficiency and
accuracy of the method is validated through well corroborated exam-
ples and benchmark problems.
